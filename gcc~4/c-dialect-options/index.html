<h1 class="section" id="C-Dialect-Options">3.4 Options Controlling C Dialect</h1> <p> The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived from C, such as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++) that the compiler accepts:   </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>-ansi</code></dt>
<dd>
In C mode, this is equivalent to <code>-std=c90</code>. In C++ mode, it is equivalent to <code>-std=c++98</code>. <p>This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code), such as the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, and predefined macros such as <code>unix</code> and <code>vax</code> that identify the type of system you are using. It also enables the undesirable and rarely used ISO trigraph feature. For the C compiler, it disables recognition of C++ style ‘<code>//</code>’ comments as well as the <code>inline</code> keyword. </p>
<p>The alternate keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__extension__</code>, <code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code> continue to work despite <code>-ansi</code>. You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included in compilations done with <code>-ansi</code>. Alternate predefined macros such as <code>__unix__</code> and <code>__vax__</code> are also available, with or without <code>-ansi</code>. </p>
<p>The <code>-ansi</code> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be rejected gratuitously. For that, <code>-Wpedantic</code> is required in addition to <code>-ansi</code>. See <a href="../warning-options/#Warning-Options">Warning Options</a>. </p>
<p>The macro <code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code> is predefined when the <code>-ansi</code> option is used. Some header files may notice this macro and refrain from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any programs that might use these names for other things. </p>
<p>Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics defined by ISO C (such as <code>alloca</code> and <code>ffs</code>) are not built-in functions when <code>-ansi</code> is used. See <a href="../other-builtins/#Other-Builtins">Other built-in functions provided by GCC</a>, for details of the functions affected. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-std=</code></dt>
<dd>
Determine the language standard. See <a href="../standards/#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of these standard versions. This option is currently only supported when compiling C or C++. <p>The compiler can accept several base standards, such as ‘<code>c90</code>’ or ‘<code>c++98</code>’, and GNU dialects of those standards, such as ‘<code>gnu90</code>’ or ‘<code>gnu++98</code>’. When a base standard is specified, the compiler accepts all programs following that standard plus those using GNU extensions that do not contradict it. For example, <code>-std=c90</code> turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C90, such as the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in ISO C90, such as omitting the middle term of a <code>?:</code> expression. On the other hand, when a GNU dialect of a standard is specified, all features supported by the compiler are enabled, even when those features change the meaning of the base standard. As a result, some strict-conforming programs may be rejected. The particular standard is used by <code>-Wpedantic</code> to identify which features are GNU extensions given that version of the standard. For example <code>-std=gnu90 -Wpedantic</code> warns about C++ style ‘<code>//</code>’ comments, while <code>-std=gnu99 -Wpedantic</code> does not. </p>
<p>A value for this option must be provided; possible values are </p>
<dl> <dt>‘<code>c90</code>’<dt>‘<code>c89</code>’<dt>‘<code>iso9899:1990</code>’</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>Support all ISO C90 programs (certain GNU extensions that conflict with ISO C90 are disabled). Same as <code>-ansi</code> for C code. </dd>

<dd>ISO C99. This standard is substantially completely supported, modulo bugs, extended identifiers (supported except for corner cases when <code>-fextended-identifiers</code> is used) and floating-point issues (mainly but not entirely relating to optional C99 features from Annexes F and G). See <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html" target="_blank">http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html</a> for more information.

This standard is substantially completely supported, modulo bugs, extended identifiers (supported except for corner cases when <code>-fextended-identifiers</code> is used), floating-point issues (mainly but not entirely relating to optional C11 features from Annexes F and G) and the optional Annexes K (Bounds-checking interfaces) and L (Analyzability). The name ‘<code>c1x</code>’ is deprecated. </dd>

</dl> </dd>
<dt><code>-fgnu89-inline</code></dt>
<dd>
The option <code>-fgnu89-inline</code> tells GCC to use the traditional GNU semantics for <code>inline</code> functions when in C99 mode. See <a href="../inline/#Inline">An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro</a>. This option is accepted and ignored by GCC versions 4.1.3 up to but not including 4.3. In GCC versions 4.3 and later it changes the behavior of GCC in C99 mode. Using this option is roughly equivalent to adding the <code>gnu_inline</code> function attribute to all inline functions (see <a href="../function-attributes/#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>). <p>The option <code>-fno-gnu89-inline</code> explicitly tells GCC to use the C99 semantics for <code>inline</code> when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e., it specifies the default behavior). This option was first supported in GCC 4.3. This option is not supported in <code>-std=c90</code> or <code>-std=gnu90</code> mode. </p>
<p>The preprocessor macros <code>__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__</code> and <code>__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__</code> may be used to check which semantics are in effect for <code>inline</code> functions. See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.3/cpp/Common-Predefined-Macros.html#Common-Predefined-Macros" target="_blank">Common Predefined Macros</a>. </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>-aux-info </code><var>filename</var>
</dt>
<dd>
Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions declared and/or defined in a translation unit, including those in header files. This option is silently ignored in any language other than C. <p>Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (‘<code>I</code>’, ‘<code>N</code>’ for new or ‘<code>O</code>’ for old, respectively, in the first character after the line number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a definition (‘<code>C</code>’ or ‘<code>F</code>’, respectively, in the following character). In the case of function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of arguments followed by their declarations is also provided, inside comments, after the declaration. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fallow-parameterless-variadic-functions</code></dt>
<dd>
Accept variadic functions without named parameters. <p>Although it is possible to define such a function, this is not very useful as it is not possible to read the arguments. This is only supported for C as this construct is allowed by C++. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-asm</code></dt>
<dd>
Do not recognize <code>asm</code>, <code>inline</code> or <code>typeof</code> as a keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers. You can use the keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code> instead. <code>-ansi</code> implies <code>-fno-asm</code>. <p>In C++, this switch only affects the <code>typeof</code> keyword, since <code>asm</code> and <code>inline</code> are standard keywords. You may want to use the <code>-fno-gnu-keywords</code> flag instead, which has the same effect. In C99 mode (<code>-std=c99</code> or <code>-std=gnu99</code>), this switch only affects the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, since <code>inline</code> is a standard keyword in ISO C99. </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>-fno-builtin</code><dt>
<code>-fno-builtin-</code><var>function</var>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with ‘<code>__builtin_</code>’ as prefix. See <a href="../other-builtins/#Other-Builtins">Other built-in functions provided by GCC</a>, for details of the functions affected, including those which are not built-in functions when <code>-ansi</code> or <code>-std</code> options for strict ISO C conformance are used because they do not have an ISO standard meaning. <p>GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to <code>alloca</code> may become single instructions which adjust the stack directly, and calls to <code>memcpy</code> may become inline copy loops. The resulting code is often both smaller and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by linking with a different library. In addition, when a function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use information about that function to warn about problems with calls to that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the resulting code still contains calls to that function. For example, warnings are given with <code>-Wformat</code> for bad calls to <code>printf</code> when <code>printf</code> is built in and <code>strlen</code> is known not to modify global memory. </p>
<p>With the <samp><span class="option">-fno-builtin-</span><var>function</var></samp> option only the built-in function <var>function</var> is disabled. <var>function</var> must not begin with ‘<code>__builtin_</code>’. If a function is named that is not built-in in this version of GCC, this option is ignored. There is no corresponding <samp><span class="option">-fbuiltin-</span><var>function</var></samp> option; if you wish to enable built-in functions selectively when using <code>-fno-builtin</code> or <code>-ffreestanding</code>, you may define macros such as: </p>
<pre class="smallexample">#define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
#define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))</pre> </dd>
<dt><code>-fhosted</code></dt>
<dd>
 Assert that compilation targets a hosted environment. This implies <code>-fbuiltin</code>. A hosted environment is one in which the entire standard library is available, and in which <code>main</code> has a return type of <code>int</code>. Examples are nearly everything except a kernel. This is equivalent to <code>-fno-freestanding</code>. </dd>
<dt><code>-ffreestanding</code></dt>
<dd>
 Assert that compilation targets a freestanding environment. This implies <code>-fno-builtin</code>. A freestanding environment is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may not necessarily be at <code>main</code>. The most obvious example is an OS kernel. This is equivalent to <code>-fno-hosted</code>. <p>See <a href="../standards/#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of freestanding and hosted environments. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fopenmp</code></dt>
<dd>
Enable handling of OpenMP directives <code>#pragma omp</code> in C/C++ and <code>!$omp</code> in Fortran. When <code>-fopenmp</code> is specified, the compiler generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application Program Interface v4.0 <a href="http://www.openmp.org/" target="_blank">http://www.openmp.org/</a>. This option implies <code>-pthread</code>, and thus is only supported on targets that have support for <code>-pthread</code>. <code>-fopenmp</code> implies <code>-fopenmp-simd</code>. </dd>
<dt><code>-fopenmp-simd</code></dt>
<dd>
Enable handling of OpenMP's SIMD directives with <code>#pragma omp</code> in C/C++ and <code>!$omp</code> in Fortran. Other OpenMP directives are ignored. </dd>
<dt><code>-fcilkplus</code></dt>
<dd>
Enable the usage of Cilk Plus language extension features for C/C++. When the option <code>-fcilkplus</code> is specified, enable the usage of the Cilk Plus Language extension features for C/C++. The present implementation follows ABI version 1.2. This is an experimental feature that is only partially complete, and whose interface may change in future versions of GCC as the official specification changes. Currently, all features but <code>_Cilk_for</code> have been implemented. </dd>
<dt><code>-fgnu-tm</code></dt>
<dd>
When the option <code>-fgnu-tm</code> is specified, the compiler generates code for the Linux variant of Intel's current Transactional Memory ABI specification document (Revision 1.1, May 6 2009). This is an experimental feature whose interface may change in future versions of GCC, as the official specification changes. Please note that not all architectures are supported for this feature. <p>For more information on GCC's support for transactional memory, See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.3/libitm/Enabling-libitm.html#Enabling-libitm" target="_blank">The GNU Transactional Memory Library</a>. </p>
<p>Note that the transactional memory feature is not supported with non-call exceptions (<code>-fnon-call-exceptions</code>). </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fms-extensions</code></dt>
<dd>
Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files. <p>In C++ code, this allows member names in structures to be similar to previous types declarations. </p>
<pre class="smallexample">typedef int UOW;
struct ABC {
  UOW UOW;
};</pre> <p>Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only accepted with this option. See <a href="../unnamed-fields/#Unnamed-Fields">Unnamed struct/union fields within structs/unions</a>, for details. </p>
<p>Note that this option is off for all targets but i?86 and x86_64 targets using ms-abi. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fplan9-extensions</code></dt>
<dd>Accept some non-standard constructs used in Plan 9 code. <p>This enables <code>-fms-extensions</code>, permits passing pointers to structures with anonymous fields to functions that expect pointers to elements of the type of the field, and permits referring to anonymous fields declared using a typedef. See <a href="../unnamed-fields/#Unnamed-Fields">Unnamed struct/union fields within structs/unions</a>, for details. This is only supported for C, not C++. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-trigraphs</code></dt>
<dd>
Support ISO C trigraphs. The <code>-ansi</code> option (and <code>-std</code> options for strict ISO C conformance) implies <code>-trigraphs</code>. 
</dd>
<dt>
<code>-traditional</code><dt><code>-traditional-cpp</code></dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Formerly, these options caused GCC to attempt to emulate a pre-standard C compiler. They are now only supported with the <code>-E</code> switch. The preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard mode. See the GNU CPP manual for details. </dd>
<dt><code>-fcond-mismatch</code></dt>
<dd>
Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and third arguments. The value of such an expression is void. This option is not supported for C++. </dd>
<dt><code>-flax-vector-conversions</code></dt>
<dd>
Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing numbers of elements and/or incompatible element types. This option should not be used for new code. </dd>
<dt><code>-funsigned-char</code></dt>
<dd>
Let the type <code>char</code> be unsigned, like <code>unsigned char</code>. <p>Each kind of machine has a default for what <code>char</code> should be. It is either like <code>unsigned char</code> by default or like <code>signed char</code> by default. </p>
<p>Ideally, a portable program should always use <code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code> when it depends on the signedness of an object. But many programs have been written to use plain <code>char</code> and expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the machines they were written for. This option, and its inverse, let you make such a program work with the opposite default. </p>
<p>The type <code>char</code> is always a distinct type from each of <code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code>, even though its behavior is always just like one of those two. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsigned-char</code></dt>
<dd>
Let the type <code>char</code> be signed, like <code>signed char</code>. <p>Note that this is equivalent to <code>-fno-unsigned-char</code>, which is the negative form of <code>-funsigned-char</code>. Likewise, the option <code>-fno-signed-char</code> is equivalent to <code>-funsigned-char</code>. </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>-fsigned-bitfields</code><dt>
<code>-funsigned-bitfields</code><dt>
<code>-fno-signed-bitfields</code><dt><code>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</code></dt>
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the declaration does not use either <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code>. By default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the basic integer types such as <code>int</code> are signed types. </dd>
