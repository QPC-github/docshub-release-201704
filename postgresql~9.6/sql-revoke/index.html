</pre> </div> <div class="REFSECT1" id="SQL-REVOKE-DESCRIPTION">  <h2>Description</h2> <p>The <code class="COMMAND">REVOKE</code> command revokes previously granted privileges from one or more roles. The key word <code class="LITERAL">PUBLIC</code> refers to the implicitly defined group of all roles.</p> <p>See the description of the <a href="../sql-grant/">GRANT</a> command for the meaning of the privilege types.</p> <p>Note that any particular role will have the sum of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted to any role it is presently a member of, and privileges granted to <code class="LITERAL">PUBLIC</code>. Thus, for example, revoking <code class="LITERAL">SELECT</code> privilege from <code class="LITERAL">PUBLIC</code> does not necessarily mean that all roles have lost <code class="LITERAL">SELECT</code> privilege on the object: those who have it granted directly or via another role will still have it. Similarly, revoking <code class="LITERAL">SELECT</code> from a user might not prevent that user from using <code class="LITERAL">SELECT</code> if <code class="LITERAL">PUBLIC</code> or another membership role still has <code class="LITERAL">SELECT</code> rights.</p> <p>If <code class="LITERAL">GRANT OPTION FOR</code> is specified, only the grant option for the privilege is revoked, not the privilege itself. Otherwise, both the privilege and the grant option are revoked.</p> <p>If a user holds a privilege with grant option and has granted it to other users then the privileges held by those other users are called dependent privileges. If the privilege or the grant option held by the first user is being revoked and dependent privileges exist, those dependent privileges are also revoked if <code class="LITERAL">CASCADE</code> is specified; if it is not, the revoke action will fail. This recursive revocation only affects privileges that were granted through a chain of users that is traceable to the user that is the subject of this <code class="LITERAL">REVOKE</code> command. Thus, the affected users might effectively keep the privilege if it was also granted through other users.</p> <p>When revoking privileges on a table, the corresponding column privileges (if any) are automatically revoked on each column of the table, as well. On the other hand, if a role has been granted privileges on a table, then revoking the same privileges from individual columns will have no effect.</p> <p>When revoking membership in a role, <code class="LITERAL">GRANT OPTION</code> is instead called <code class="LITERAL">ADMIN OPTION</code>, but the behavior is similar. Note also that this form of the command does not allow the noise word <code class="LITERAL">GROUP</code>.</p> </div> <div class="REFSECT1" id="SQL-REVOKE-NOTES">  <h2>Notes</h2> <p>Use <a href="../app-psql/"><span class="APPLICATION">psql</span></a>'s <code class="COMMAND">\dp</code> command to display the privileges granted on existing tables and columns. See <a href="../sql-grant/">GRANT</a> for information about the format. For non-table objects there are other <code class="COMMAND">\d</code> commands that can display their privileges.</p> <p>A user can only revoke privileges that were granted directly by that user. If, for example, user A has granted a privilege with grant option to user B, and user B has in turned granted it to user C, then user A cannot revoke the privilege directly from C. Instead, user A could revoke the grant option from user B and use the <code class="LITERAL">CASCADE</code> option so that the privilege is in turn revoked from user C. For another example, if both A and B have granted the same privilege to C, A can revoke their own grant but not B's grant, so C will still effectively have the privilege.</p> <p>When a non-owner of an object attempts to <code class="COMMAND">REVOKE</code> privileges on the object, the command will fail outright if the user has no privileges whatsoever on the object. As long as some privilege is available, the command will proceed, but it will revoke only those privileges for which the user has grant options. The <code class="COMMAND">REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES</code> forms will issue a warning message if no grant options are held, while the other forms will issue a warning if grant options for any of the privileges specifically named in the command are not held. (In principle these statements apply to the object owner as well, but since the owner is always treated as holding all grant options, the cases can never occur.)</p> <p>If a superuser chooses to issue a <code class="COMMAND">GRANT</code> or <code class="COMMAND">REVOKE</code> command, the command is performed as though it were issued by the owner of the affected object. Since all privileges ultimately come from the object owner (possibly indirectly via chains of grant options), it is possible for a superuser to revoke all privileges, but this might require use of <code class="LITERAL">CASCADE</code> as stated above.</p> <p><code class="COMMAND">REVOKE</code> can also be done by a role that is not the owner of the affected object, but is a member of the role that owns the object, or is a member of a role that holds privileges <code class="LITERAL">WITH GRANT OPTION</code> on the object. In this case the command is performed as though it were issued by the containing role that actually owns the object or holds the privileges <code class="LITERAL">WITH GRANT OPTION</code>. For example, if table <code class="LITERAL">t1</code> is owned by role <code class="LITERAL">g1</code>, of which role <code class="LITERAL">u1</code> is a member, then <code class="LITERAL">u1</code> can revoke privileges on <code class="LITERAL">t1</code> that are recorded as being granted by <code class="LITERAL">g1</code>. This would include grants made by <code class="LITERAL">u1</code> as well as by other members of role <code class="LITERAL">g1</code>.</p> <p>If the role executing <code class="COMMAND">REVOKE</code> holds privileges indirectly via more than one role membership path, it is unspecified which containing role will be used to perform the command. In such cases it is best practice to use <code class="COMMAND">SET ROLE</code> to become the specific role you want to do the <code class="COMMAND">REVOKE</code> as. Failure to do so might lead to revoking privileges other than the ones you intended, or not revoking anything at all.</p> </div> <div class="REFSECT1" id="SQL-REVOKE-EXAMPLES">  <h2>Examples</h2> <p>Revoke insert privilege for the public on table <code class="LITERAL">films</code>:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
