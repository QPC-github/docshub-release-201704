<h1 class="SECT1" id="DDL-SCHEMAS">5.8. Schemas</h1> <p>A <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> database cluster contains one or more named databases. Users and groups of users are shared across the entire cluster, but no other data is shared across databases. Any given client connection to the server can access only the data in a single database, the one specified in the connection request.</p>  <blockquote class="NOTE"> <p><b>Note:</b> Users of a cluster do not necessarily have the privilege to access every database in the cluster. Sharing of user names means that there cannot be different users named, say, <code class="LITERAL">joe</code> in two databases in the same cluster; but the system can be configured to allow <code class="LITERAL">joe</code> access to only some of the databases.</p> </blockquote>  <p>A database contains one or more named <i class="FIRSTTERM">schemas</i>, which in turn contain tables. Schemas also contain other kinds of named objects, including data types, functions, and operators. The same object name can be used in different schemas without conflict; for example, both <code class="LITERAL">schema1</code> and <code class="LITERAL">myschema</code> can contain tables named <code class="LITERAL">mytable</code>. Unlike databases, schemas are not rigidly separated: a user can access objects in any of the schemas in the database they are connected to, if they have privileges to do so.</p> <p>There are several reasons why one might want to use schemas:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To allow many users to use one database without interfering with each other.</p> </li> <li> <p>To organize database objects into logical groups to make them more manageable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Third-party applications can be put into separate schemas so they do not collide with the names of other objects.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Schemas are analogous to directories at the operating system level, except that schemas cannot be nested.</p> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="DDL-SCHEMAS-CREATE">5.8.1. Creating a Schema</h2> <p>To create a schema, use the <a href="../sql-createschema/">CREATE SCHEMA</a> command. Give the schema a name of your choice. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
CREATE SCHEMA myschema;
</pre> <p>To create or access objects in a schema, write a <i class="FIRSTTERM">qualified name</i> consisting of the schema name and table name separated by a dot:</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
schema.table
</pre> <p>This works anywhere a table name is expected, including the table modification commands and the data access commands discussed in the following chapters. (For brevity we will speak of tables only, but the same ideas apply to other kinds of named objects, such as types and functions.)</p> <p>Actually, the even more general syntax</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
database.schema.table
</pre> <p>can be used too, but at present this is just for <i class="FOREIGNPHRASE">pro forma</i> compliance with the SQL standard. If you write a database name, it must be the same as the database you are connected to.</p> <p>So to create a table in the new schema, use:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
CREATE TABLE myschema.mytable (
 ...
);
</pre> <p>To drop a schema if it's empty (all objects in it have been dropped), use:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
DROP SCHEMA myschema;
</pre> <p>To drop a schema including all contained objects, use:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
DROP SCHEMA myschema CASCADE;
</pre> <p>See <a href="../ddl-depend/">Section 5.13</a> for a description of the general mechanism behind this.</p> <p>Often you will want to create a schema owned by someone else (since this is one of the ways to restrict the activities of your users to well-defined namespaces). The syntax for that is:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
CREATE SCHEMA schema_name AUTHORIZATION user_name;
</pre> <p>You can even omit the schema name, in which case the schema name will be the same as the user name. See <a href="../ddl-schemas/#DDL-SCHEMAS-PATTERNS">Section 5.8.6</a> for how this can be useful.</p> <p>Schema names beginning with <code class="LITERAL">pg_</code> are reserved for system purposes and cannot be created by users.</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="DDL-SCHEMAS-PUBLIC">5.8.2. The Public Schema</h2> <p>In the previous sections we created tables without specifying any schema names. By default such tables (and other objects) are automatically put into a schema named <span class="QUOTE">"public"</span>. Every new database contains such a schema. Thus, the following are equivalent:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
CREATE TABLE products ( ... );
</pre> <p>and:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
CREATE TABLE public.products ( ... );
</pre> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="DDL-SCHEMAS-PATH">5.8.3. The Schema Search Path</h2> <p>Qualified names are tedious to write, and it's often best not to wire a particular schema name into applications anyway. Therefore tables are often referred to by <i class="FIRSTTERM">unqualified names</i>, which consist of just the table name. The system determines which table is meant by following a <i class="FIRSTTERM">search path</i>, which is a list of schemas to look in. The first matching table in the search path is taken to be the one wanted. If there is no match in the search path, an error is reported, even if matching table names exist in other schemas in the database.</p> <p>The first schema named in the search path is called the current schema. Aside from being the first schema searched, it is also the schema in which new tables will be created if the <code class="COMMAND">CREATE TABLE</code> command does not specify a schema name.</p> <p>To show the current search path, use the following command:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SHOW search_path;
</pre> <p>In the default setup this returns:</p> <pre class="SCREEN">
 search_path
--------------
 "$user", public
</pre> <p>The first element specifies that a schema with the same name as the current user is to be searched. If no such schema exists, the entry is ignored. The second element refers to the public schema that we have seen already.</p> <p>The first schema in the search path that exists is the default location for creating new objects. That is the reason that by default objects are created in the public schema. When objects are referenced in any other context without schema qualification (table modification, data modification, or query commands) the search path is traversed until a matching object is found. Therefore, in the default configuration, any unqualified access again can only refer to the public schema.</p> <p>To put our new schema in the path, we use:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SET search_path TO myschema,public;
</pre> <p>(We omit the <code class="LITERAL">$user</code> here because we have no immediate need for it.) And then we can access the table without schema qualification:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
DROP TABLE mytable;
</pre> <p>Also, since <code class="LITERAL">myschema</code> is the first element in the path, new objects would by default be created in it.</p> <p>We could also have written:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SET search_path TO myschema;
</pre> <p>Then we no longer have access to the public schema without explicit qualification. There is nothing special about the public schema except that it exists by default. It can be dropped, too.</p> <p>See also <a href="../functions-info/">Section 9.25</a> for other ways to manipulate the schema search path.</p> <p>The search path works in the same way for data type names, function names, and operator names as it does for table names. Data type and function names can be qualified in exactly the same way as table names. If you need to write a qualified operator name in an expression, there is a special provision: you must write</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
OPERATOR(schema.operator)
</pre> <p>This is needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity. An example is:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT 3 OPERATOR(pg_catalog.+) 4;
</pre> <p>In practice one usually relies on the search path for operators, so as not to have to write anything so ugly as that.</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="DDL-SCHEMAS-PRIV">5.8.4. Schemas and Privileges</h2> <p>By default, users cannot access any objects in schemas they do not own. To allow that, the owner of the schema must grant the <code class="LITERAL">USAGE</code> privilege on the schema. To allow users to make use of the objects in the schema, additional privileges might need to be granted, as appropriate for the object.</p> <p>A user can also be allowed to create objects in someone else's schema. To allow that, the <code class="LITERAL">CREATE</code> privilege on the schema needs to be granted. Note that by default, everyone has <code class="LITERAL">CREATE</code> and <code class="LITERAL">USAGE</code> privileges on the schema <code class="LITERAL">public</code>. This allows all users that are able to connect to a given database to create objects in its <code class="LITERAL">public</code> schema. If you do not want to allow that, you can revoke that privilege:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
</pre> <p>(The first <span class="QUOTE">"public"</span> is the schema, the second <span class="QUOTE">"public"</span> means <span class="QUOTE">"every user"</span>. In the first sense it is an identifier, in the second sense it is a key word, hence the different capitalization; recall the guidelines from <a href="../sql-syntax-lexical/#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS">Section 4.1.1</a>.)</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="DDL-SCHEMAS-CATALOG">5.8.5. The System Catalog Schema</h2> <p>In addition to <code class="LITERAL">public</code> and user-created schemas, each database contains a <code class="LITERAL">pg_catalog</code> schema, which contains the system tables and all the built-in data types, functions, and operators. <code class="LITERAL">pg_catalog</code> is always effectively part of the search path. If it is not named explicitly in the path then it is implicitly searched <span class="emphasis EMPHASIS c3">before</span> searching the path's schemas. This ensures that built-in names will always be findable. However, you can explicitly place <code class="LITERAL">pg_catalog</code> at the end of your search path if you prefer to have user-defined names override built-in names.</p> <p>Since system table names begin with <code class="LITERAL">pg_</code>, it is best to avoid such names to ensure that you won't suffer a conflict if some future version defines a system table named the same as your table. (With the default search path, an unqualified reference to your table name would then be resolved as the system table instead.) System tables will continue to follow the convention of having names beginning with <code class="LITERAL">pg_</code>, so that they will not conflict with unqualified user-table names so long as users avoid the <code class="LITERAL">pg_</code> prefix.</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="DDL-SCHEMAS-PATTERNS">5.8.6. Usage Patterns</h2> <p>Schemas can be used to organize your data in many ways. There are a few usage patterns that are recommended and are easily supported by the default configuration:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you do not create any schemas then all users access the public schema implicitly. This simulates the situation where schemas are not available at all. This setup is mainly recommended when there is only a single user or a few cooperating users in a database. This setup also allows smooth transition from the non-schema-aware world.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can create a schema for each user with the same name as that user. Recall that the default search path starts with <code class="LITERAL">$user</code>, which resolves to the user name. Therefore, if each user has a separate schema, they access their own schemas by default.</p> <p>If you use this setup then you might also want to revoke access to the public schema (or drop it altogether), so users are truly constrained to their own schemas.</p> </li> <li> <p>To install shared applications (tables to be used by everyone, additional functions provided by third parties, etc.), put them into separate schemas. Remember to grant appropriate privileges to allow the other users to access them. Users can then refer to these additional objects by qualifying the names with a schema name, or they can put the additional schemas into their search path, as they choose.</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="DDL-SCHEMAS-PORTABILITY">5.8.7. Portability</h2> <p>In the SQL standard, the notion of objects in the same schema being owned by different users does not exist. Moreover, some implementations do not allow you to create schemas that have a different name than their owner. In fact, the concepts of schema and user are nearly equivalent in a database system that implements only the basic schema support specified in the standard. Therefore, many users consider qualified names to really consist of <code class="LITERAL"><code class="REPLACEABLE c2">user_name</code>.<code class="REPLACEABLE c2">table_name</code></code>. This is how <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> will effectively behave if you create a per-user schema for every user.</p> <p>Also, there is no concept of a <code class="LITERAL">public</code> schema in the SQL standard. For maximum conformance to the standard, you should not use (perhaps even remove) the <code class="LITERAL">public</code> schema.</p> <p>Of course, some SQL database systems might not implement schemas at all, or provide namespace support by allowing (possibly limited) cross-database access. If you need to work with those systems, then maximum portability would be achieved by not using schemas at all.</p> </div>  <div class="NAVFOOTER">  <table summary="Footer navigation table"> <tr> <td width="33%" align="left"><a href="../ddl-rowsecurity/" accesskey="P">Prev</a></td> <td width="34%" align="center"></td> <td width="33%" align="right"><a href="../ddl-inherit/" accesskey="N">Next</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="33%" align="left">Row Security Policies</td> <td width="34%" align="center"><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/ddl.html" accesskey="U" target="_blank">Up</a></td> <td width="33%" align="right">Inheritance</td> </tr> </table> </div>
