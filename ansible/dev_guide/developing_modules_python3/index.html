<h1 id="ansible-and-porting-to-python-3">Ansible and Porting to Python 3</h1> <p>Ansible can be divided into three overlapping pieces for the purposes of porting:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>Controller-side code. This is the code which runs on the machine where you invoke /usr/bin/ansible</li> <li>Modules. This is the code which Ansible transmits over the wire and invokes on the managed machine.</li> <li>module_utils code. This is code whose primary purpose is to be used by the modules to perform tasks. However, some controller-side code might use generic functions from here.</li> </ol> <p>Much of the knowledge of porting code will be usable on all three of these pieces but there are some special considerations for some of it as well.</p>  <h2 id="minimum-version-of-python-3-x-and-python-2-x">Minimum Version of Python-3.x and Python-2.x</h2> <p>In controller side code, we support Python-3.5 or greater and Python-2.6 or greater.</p> <p>For modules (and by extension, module_utils) we support Python-3.5 and Python-2.4. Python-3.5 was chosen as a minimum because it is the earliest Python-3 version adopted as the default Python by a Long Term Support (LTS) Linux distribution (in this case, Ubuntu-16.04). Previous LTS Linux distributions shipped with a Python-2 version which users can rely upon instead of the Python-3 version.</p> <p>For Python-2, the default is for modules to run on Python-2.4. This allows users with older distributions that are stuck on Python-2.4 to manage their machines. Modules are allowed to drop support for Python-2.4 when one of their dependent libraries requires a higher version of Python. This is not an invitation to add unnecessary dependent libraries in order to force your module to be usable only with a newer version of Python.; instead it is an acknowledgment that some libraries (for instance, boto3 and docker-py) will only function with a newer version of Python.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p>Python-2.4 Support:</p> <p class="last">The only long term supported distro that we know of with Python-2.4 support is RHEL5 (and its rebuilds like CentOS5), which is supported until April of 2017. For Ansible, that means Ansible-2.3 will be the last major release that supports Python-2.4 for modules. Ansible-2.4 will require Python-2.6 or greater for modules.</p> </div>   <h2 id="porting-controller-code-to-python-3">Porting Controller Code to Python 3</h2> <p>Most of the general tips for porting code to be used on both Python-2 and Python-3 applies to porting controller code. The best place to start learning to port code is <a class="reference external" href="http://python3porting.com/" target="_blank">Lennart Regebro’s book: Porting to Python 3</a>.</p> <p>The book describes several strategies for porting to Python 3. The one we’re using is <a class="reference external" href="http://python3porting.com/strategies.html#python-2-and-python-3-without-conversion" target="_blank">to support Python-2 and Python-3 from a single code base</a></p>  <h3 id="controller-string-strategy">Controller String Strategy</h3>  <h4 id="background">Background</h4> <p>One of the most essential things to decide upon for porting code to Python-3 is what string model to use. Strings can be an array of bytes (like in C) or they can be an array of text. Text is what we think of as letters, digits, numbers, other printable symbols, and a small number of unprintable “symbols” (control codes).</p> <p>In Python-2, the two types for these (<code>str</code> for bytes and <code>unicode</code> for text) are often used interchangably. When dealing only with ASCII characters, the strings can be combined, compared, and converted from one type to another automatically. When non-ASCII characters are introduced, Python starts throwing exceptions due to not knowing what encoding the non-ASCII characters should be in.</p> <p>Python-3 changes this behavior by making the separation between bytes (<code>bytes</code>) and text (<code>str</code>) more strict. Python will throw an exception when trying to combine and compare the two types. The programmer has to explicitly convert from one type to the other to mix values from each.</p> <p>This change makes it immediately apparent to the programmer when code is mixing the types inappropriately, rather than working until one of their users causes an exception by entering non-ASCII input. However, it forces the programmer to proactively define a strategy for working with strings in their program so that they don’t mix text and byte strings unintentionally.</p>   <h4 id="unicode-sandwich">Unicode Sandwich</h4> <p>In controller-side code we use a strategy known as the Unicode Sandwich (named after Python-2’s <code>unicode</code> text type). For Unicode Sandwich we know that at the border of our code and the outside world (for example, file and network IO, environment variables, and some library calls) we are going to receive bytes. We need to transform these bytes into text and use that throughout the internal portions of our code. When we have to send those strings back out to the outside world we first convert the text back into bytes. To visualize this, imagine a ‘sandwich’ consisting of a top and bottom layer of bytes, a layer of conversion between, and all text type in the center.</p>   <h4 id="common-borders">Common Borders</h4> <p>This is a partial list of places where we have to convert to and from bytes. It’s not exhaustive but gives you an idea of where to watch for problems.</p>  <h5 id="reading-and-writing-to-files">Reading and writing to files</h5> <p>In Python-2, reading from files yields bytes. In Python-3, it can yield text. To make code that’s portable to both we don’t make use of Python-3’s ability to yield text but instead do the conversion explicitly ourselves. For example:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">from ansible.module_utils._text import to_text

with open('filename-with-utf8-data.txt', 'rb') as my_file:
    b_data = my_file.read()
    try:
        data = to_text(b_data, errors='surrogate_or_strict')
    except UnicodeError:
        # Handle the exception gracefully -- usually by displaying a good
        # user-centric error message that can be traced back to this piece
        # of code.
</pre> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">Much of Ansible assumes that all encoded text is UTF-8. At some point, if there is demand for other encodings we may change that, but for now it is safe to assume that bytes are UTF-8.</p> </div> <p>Writing to files is the opposite process:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">from ansible.module_utils._text import to_bytes

with open('filename.txt', 'wb') as my_file:
    my_file.write(to_bytes(some_text_string))
</pre> <p>Note that we don’t have to catch <code>UnicodeError</code> here because we’re transforming to UTF-8 and all text strings in Python can be transformed back to UTF-8.</p>   <h5 id="filesystem-interaction">Filesystem Interaction</h5> <p>Dealing with filenames often involves dropping back to bytes because on UNIX-like systems filenames are bytes. On Python-2, if we pass a text string to these functions, the text string will be converted to a byte string inside of the function and a traceback will occur if non-ASCII characters are present. In Python-3, a traceback will only occur if the text string can’t be decoded in the current locale, but it’s still good to be explicit and have code which works on both versions:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">import os.path

from ansible.module_utils._text import to_bytes

filename = u'/var/tmp/くらとみ.txt'
f = open(to_bytes(filename), 'wb')
mtime = os.path.getmtime(to_bytes(filename))
b_filename = os.path.expandvars(to_bytes(filename))
if os.path.exists(to_bytes(filename)):
    pass
</pre> <p>When you are only manipulating a filename as a string without talking to the filesystem (or a C library which talks to the filesystem) you can often get away without converting to bytes:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">import os.path

os.path.join(u'/var/tmp/café', u'くらとみ')
os.path.split(u'/var/tmp/café/くらとみ')
</pre> <p>On the other hand, if the code needs to manipulate the filename and also talk to the filesystem, it can be more convenient to transform to bytes right away and manipulate in bytes.</p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p> <p class="last">Make sure all variables passed to a function are the same type. If you’re working with something like <code>os.path.join()</code> which takes multiple strings and uses them in combination, you need to make sure that all the types are the same (either all bytes or all text). Mixing bytes and text will cause tracebacks.</p> </div>   <h5 id="interacting-with-other-programs">Interacting with Other Programs</h5> <p>Interacting with other programs goes through the operating system and C libraries and operates on things that the UNIX kernel defines. These interfaces are all byte-oriented so the Python interface is byte oriented as well. On both Python-2 and Python-3, byte strings should be given to Python’s subprocess library and byte strings should be expected back from it.</p> <p>One of the main places in Ansible’s controller code that we interact with other programs is the connection plugins’ <code>exec_command</code> methods. These methods transform any text strings they receive in the command (and arugments to the command) to execute into bytes and return stdout and stderr as byte strings Higher level functions (like action plugins’ <code>_low_level_execute_command</code>) transform the output into text strings.</p>     <h3 id="tips-tricks-and-idioms-to-adopt">Tips, tricks, and idioms to adopt</h3>  <h4 id="forwards-compatibility-boilerplate">Forwards Compatibility Boilerplate</h4> <p>Use the following boilerplate code at the top of all controller-side modules to make certain constructs act the same way on Python-2 and Python-3:</p> <pre data-language="yaml"># Make coding more python3-ish
from __future__ import (absolute_import, division, print_function)
__metaclass__ = type
</pre> <p><code>__metaclass__ = type</code> makes all classes defined in the file into new-style classes without explicitly inheriting from <code>object</code>.</p> <p>The <code>__future__</code> imports do the following:</p> <table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none"> <col class="field-name"> <col class="field-body">  <tr class="field-odd field"><th class="field-name" colspan="2">absolute_import:</th></tr> <tr class="field-odd field">
<td> </td>
<td class="field-body">Makes imports look in <code>sys.path</code> for the modules being imported, skipping the directory in which the module doing the importing lives. If the code wants to use the directory in which the module doing the importing, there’s a new dot notation to do so.</td> </tr> <tr class="field-even field">
<th class="field-name">division:</th>
<td class="field-body">Makes division of integers always return a float. If you need to find the quotient use <code>x // y</code> instead of <code>x / y</code>.</td> </tr> <tr class="field-odd field">
<th class="field-name">print_function:</th>
<td class="field-body">Changes <code>print()</code> from a keyword into a function.</td> </tr>  </table> <div class="admonition seealso"> <p class="first admonition-title">See also</p> <ul class="last simple"> <li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/#guido-s-decision" target="_blank">PEP 0328: Absolute Imports</a></li> <li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238" target="_blank">PEP 0238: Division</a></li> <li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3105" target="_blank">PEP 3105: Print function</a></li> </ul> </div>   <h4 id="prefix-byte-strings-with-b">Prefix byte strings with “b_”</h4> <p>Since mixing text and bytes types leads to tracebacks we want to be clear about what variables hold text and what variables hold bytes. We do this by prefixing any variable holding bytes with <code>b_</code>. For instance:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">filename = u'/var/tmp/café.txt'
b_filename = to_bytes(filename)
with open(b_filename) as f:
    data = f.read()
</pre> <p>We do not prefix the text strings instead because we only operate on byte strings at the borders, so there are fewer variables that need bytes than text.</p>     <h2 id="porting-modules-to-python-3">Porting Modules to Python 3</h2> <p>Ansible modules are not the usual Python-3 porting exercise. There are two factors that make it harder to port them than most code:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>Many modules need to run on Python-2.4 in addition to Python-3.</li> <li>A lot of mocking has to go into unit testing a Python-3 module, so it’s harder to test that your porting has fixed everything or to to make sure that later commits haven’t regressed.</li> </ol>  <h3 id="module-string-strategy">Module String Strategy</h3> <p>There are a large number of modules in Ansible. Most of those are maintained by the Ansible community at large, not by a centralized team. To make life easier on them, it was decided not to break backwards compatibility by mandating that all strings inside of modules are text and converting between text and bytes at the borders; instead, we’re using a native string strategy for now.</p>   <h3 id="id1">Tips, tricks, and idioms to adopt</h3>  <h4 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h4> <p>In code which already needs Python-2.6+ (for instance, because a library it depends on only runs on Python &gt;= 2.6) it is okay to port directly to the new exception-catching syntax:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">try:
    a = 2/0
except ValueError as e:
    module.fail_json(msg="Tried to divide by zero!")
</pre> <p>For modules which also run on Python-2.4, we have to use an uglier construction to make this work under both Python-2.4 and Python-3:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">from ansible.module_utils.pycompat24 import get_exception
[...]

try:
    a = 2/0
except ValueError:
    e = get_exception()
    module.fail_json(msg="Tried to divide by zero!")
</pre>   <h4 id="octal-numbers">Octal numbers</h4> <p>In Python-2.4, octal literals are specified as <code>0755</code>. In Python-3, that is invalid and octals must be specified as <code>0o755</code>. To bridge this gap, modules should create their octals like this:</p> <pre data-language="yaml"># Can't use 0755 on Python-3 and can't use 0o755 on Python-2.4
EXECUTABLE_PERMS = int('0755', 8)
</pre>   <h4 id="bundled-six">Bundled six</h4> <p>The third-party python-six library exists to help projects create code that runs on both Python-2 and Python-3. Ansible includes version 1.4.1 in module_utils so that other modules can use it without requiring that it is installed on the remote system. To make use of it, import it like this:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">from ansible.module_utils import six
</pre> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p>Why version 1.4.1?</p> <p class="last">six-1.4.1 is the last version of python-six to support Python-2.4. As long as Ansible modules need to run on Python-2.4 we won’t be able to update the bundled copy of six.</p> </div>   <h4 id="compile-test">Compile Test</h4> <p>We have travis compiling all modules with various versions of Python to check that the modules conform to the syntax at those versions. When you’ve ported a module so that its syntax works with Python-3, we need to modify .travis.yml so that the module is included in the syntax check. Here’s the relevant section of .travis.yml:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">env:
  global:
    - PY3_EXCLUDE_LIST="cloud/amazon/cloudformation.py
      cloud/amazon/ec2_ami.py
      [...]
      utilities/logic/wait_for.py"
</pre> <p>The <code id="index-0">PY3_EXCLUDE_LIST</code> environment variable is a blacklist of modules which should not be tested (because we know that they are older modules which have not yet been ported to pass the Python-3 syntax checks. To get another old module to compile with Python-3, remove the entry for it from the list. The goal is to have the LIST be empty.</p>     <h2 id="porting-module-utils-code-to-python-3">Porting module_utils code to Python 3</h2> <p>module_utils code is largely like module code. However, some pieces of it are used by the controller as well. Because of this, it needs to be usable with the controller’s assumptions. This is most notable in the string strategy.</p>  <h3 id="module-utils-string-strategy">Module_utils String Strategy</h3> <p>Module_utils <strong>must</strong> use the Native String Strategy. Functions in module_utils receive either text strings or byte strings and may emit either the same type as they were given or the native string for the Python version they are run on depending on which makes the most sense for that function. Functions which return strings <strong>must</strong> document whether they return text, byte, or native strings. Module-utils functions are therefore often very defensive in nature, converting from potential text or bytes at the beginning of a function and converting to the native string type at the end.</p>
