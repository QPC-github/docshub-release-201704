<td>3</td> <td>Panel</td> <td>General 3D labeled, also size-mutable array</td> </tr>  </table>  <h3 id="why-more-than-1-data-structure">Why more than 1 data structure?</h3> <p>The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container for Series, and Panel is a container for DataFrame objects. We would like to be able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like fashion.</p> <p>Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions which take into account the typical orientation of time series and cross-sectional data sets. When using ndarrays to store 2- and 3-dimensional data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular data set there is likely to be a “right” way to orient the data. The goal, then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data transformations in downstream functions.</p> <p>For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to think of the <strong>index</strong> (the rows) and the <strong>columns</strong> rather than axis 0 and axis 1. And iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more readable code:</p> <pre data-language="python">for col in df.columns:
    series = df[col]
    # do something with series
</pre>    <h2 id="mutability-and-copying-of-data">Mutability and copying of data</h2> <p>All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However, the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data untouched. In general, though, we like to <strong>favor immutability</strong> where sensible.</p>   <h2 id="getting-support">Getting Support</h2> <p>The first stop for pandas issues and ideas is the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues" target="_blank">Github Issue Tracker</a>.

a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on,
they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change
when they commit the change to one of the PyData repositories.
