<div class="_sphinx">   <p id="profiling">GHC comes with a time and space profiling system, so that you can answer questions like “why is my program so slow?”, or “why is my program using so much memory?”.</p> <p>Profiling a program is a three-step process:</p> <ol class="arabic"> <li>
<p class="first">Re-compile your program for profiling with the <a class="reference internal" href="#ghc-flag--prof"><code>-prof</code></a> option, and probably one of the options for adding automatic annotations: <a class="reference internal" href="#ghc-flag--fprof-auto"><code>-fprof-auto</code></a> is the most common <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2">[1]</a>.</p> <p>If you are using external packages with <strong class="command">cabal</strong>, you may need to reinstall these packages with profiling support; typically this is done with <code>cabal install -p package --reinstall</code>.</p> </li> <li>
<p class="first">Having compiled the program for profiling, you now need to run it to generate the profile. For example, a simple time profile can be generated by running the program with <code>+RTS -p</code> (see <a class="reference internal" href="#rts-flag--p"><code>-p</code></a>), which generates a file named <code><em>prog</em>.prof</code> where ⟨prog⟩ is the name of your program (without the <code>.exe</code> extension, if you are on Windows).</p> <p>There are many different kinds of profile that can be generated, selected by different RTS options. We will be describing the various kinds of profile throughout the rest of this chapter. Some profiles require further processing using additional tools after running the program.</p> </li> <li>Examine the generated profiling information, use the information to optimise your program, and repeat as necessary. </li> </ol>  <h2 id="cost-centres">7.1. Cost centres and cost-centre stacks</h2> <p id="cost-centres-and-cost-centre-stacks">GHC’s profiling system assigns costs to cost centres. A cost is simply the time or space (memory) required to evaluate an expression. Cost centres are program annotations around expressions; all costs incurred by the annotated expression are assigned to the enclosing cost centre. Furthermore, GHC will remember the stack of enclosing cost centres for any given expression at run-time and generate a call-tree of cost attributions.</p> <p>Let’s take a look at an example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">main = print (fib 30)
fib n = if n &lt; 2 then 1 else fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
</pre> <p>Compile and run this program as follows:</p> <pre data-language="none">$ ghc -prof -fprof-auto -rtsopts Main.hs
$ ./Main +RTS -p
121393
$
</pre> <p>When a GHC-compiled program is run with the <a class="reference internal" href="#rts-flag--p"><code>-p</code></a> RTS option, it generates a file called <code>prog.prof</code>. In this case, the file will contain something like this:</p> <pre data-language="none">        Wed Oct 12 16:14 2011 Time and Allocation Profiling Report  (Final)

</pre> <p>The first part of the file gives the program name and options, and the total time and total memory allocation measured during the run of the program (note that the total memory allocation figure isn’t the same as the amount of <em>live</em> memory needed by the program at any one time; the latter can be determined using heap profiling, which we will describe later in <a class="reference internal" href="#prof-heap">Profiling memory usage</a>).</p> <p>The second part of the file is a break-down by cost centre of the most costly functions in the program. In this case, there was only one significant function in the program, namely <code>fib</code>, and it was responsible for 100% of both the time and allocation costs of the program.</p> <p>The third and final section of the file gives a profile break-down by cost-centre stack. This is roughly a call-tree profile of the program. In the example above, it is clear that the costly call to <code>fib</code> came from <code>main</code>.</p> <p>The time and allocation incurred by a given part of the program is displayed in two ways: “individual”, which are the costs incurred by the code covered by this cost centre stack alone, and “inherited”, which includes the costs incurred by all the children of this node.</p> <p>The usefulness of cost-centre stacks is better demonstrated by modifying the example slightly:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">main = print (f 30 + g 30)
  where
    f n  = fib n
    g n  = fib (n `div` 2)

fib n = if n &lt; 2 then 1 else fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)

</pre> <p>Now although we had two calls to <code>fib</code> in the program, it is immediately clear that it was the call from <code>f</code> which took all the time. The functions <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> which are defined in the <code>where</code> clause in <code>main</code> are given their own cost centres, <code>main.f</code> and <code>main.g</code> respectively.</p> <p>The actual meaning of the various columns in the output is:</p>  <p>The number of times this particular point in the call tree was entered.</p> <p>The percentage of the total run time of the program spent at this point in the call tree.</p> <p>The percentage of the total memory allocations (excluding profiling overheads) of the program made by this call.</p> <p>The percentage of the total run time of the program spent below this point in the call tree.</p> <p>The percentage of the total memory allocations (excluding profiling overheads) of the program made by this call and all of its sub-calls.</p>  <p>In addition you can use the <a class="reference internal" href="#rts-flag--P"><code>-P</code></a> RTS option to get the following additional information:</p> <dl class="docutils"> <dt>
<code>ticks</code> </dt> <dd>The raw number of time “ticks” which were attributed to this cost-centre; from this, we get the <code>%time</code> figure mentioned above.</dd> <dt>
<code>bytes</code> </dt> <dd>Number of bytes allocated in the heap while in this cost-centre; again, this is the raw number from which we get the <code>%alloc</code> figure mentioned above.</dd> </dl> <p>What about recursive functions, and mutually recursive groups of functions? Where are the costs attributed? Well, although GHC does keep information about which groups of functions called each other recursively, this information isn’t displayed in the basic time and allocation profile, instead the call-graph is flattened into a tree as follows: a call to a function that occurs elsewhere on the current stack does not push another entry on the stack, instead the costs for this call are aggregated into the caller <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3">[2]</a>.</p>  <h3 id="scc-pragma">7.1.1. Inserting cost centres by hand</h3> <p id="inserting-cost-centres-by-hand">Cost centres are just program annotations. When you say <code>-fprof-auto</code> to the compiler, it automatically inserts a cost centre annotation around every binding not marked INLINE in your program, but you are entirely free to add cost centre annotations yourself.</p> <p>The syntax of a cost centre annotation is</p> <pre data-language="haskell">{-# SCC "name" #-} &lt;expression&gt;
</pre> <p>where <code>"name"</code> is an arbitrary string, that will become the name of your cost centre as it appears in the profiling output, and <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> is any Haskell expression. An <code>SCC</code> annotation extends as far to the right as possible when parsing. (SCC stands for “Set Cost Centre”). The double quotes can be omitted if <code>name</code> is a Haskell identifier, for example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">{-# SCC my_function #-} &lt;expression&gt;
</pre> <p>Here is an example of a program with a couple of SCCs:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">main :: IO ()

</pre>   <h3 id="prof-rules">7.1.2. Rules for attributing costs</h3> <p id="rules-for-attributing-costs">While running a program with profiling turned on, GHC maintains a cost-centre stack behind the scenes, and attributes any costs (memory allocation and time) to whatever the current cost-centre stack is at the time the cost is incurred.</p> <p>The mechanism is simple: whenever the program evaluates an expression with an SCC annotation, <code>{-# SCC c -#} E</code>, the cost centre <code>c</code> is pushed on the current stack, and the entry count for this stack is incremented by one. The stack also sometimes has to be saved and restored; in particular when the program creates a thunk (a lazy suspension), the current cost-centre stack is stored in the thunk, and restored when the thunk is evaluated. In this way, the cost-centre stack is independent of the actual evaluation order used by GHC at runtime.</p> <p>At a function call, GHC takes the stack stored in the function being called (which for a top-level function will be empty), and <em>appends</em> it to the current stack, ignoring any prefix that is identical to a prefix of the current stack.</p> <p>We mentioned earlier that lazy computations, i.e. thunks, capture the current stack when they are created, and restore this stack when they are evaluated. What about top-level thunks? They are “created” when the program is compiled, so what stack should we give them? The technical name for a top-level thunk is a CAF (“Constant Applicative Form”). GHC assigns every CAF in a module a stack consisting of the single cost centre <code>M.CAF</code>, where <code>M</code> is the name of the module. It is also possible to give each CAF a different stack, using the option <a class="reference internal" href="#ghc-flag--fprof-cafs"><code>-fprof-cafs</code></a>. This is especially useful when compiling with <a class="reference internal" href="../using-optimisation/#ghc-flag--ffull-laziness"><code>-ffull-laziness</code></a> (as is default with <a class="reference internal" href="../using-optimisation/#ghc-flag--O"><code>-O</code></a> and higher), as constants in function bodies will be lifted to the top-level and become CAFs. You will probably need to consult the Core (<a class="reference internal" href="../debugging/#ghc-flag--ddump-simpl"><code>-ddump-simpl</code></a>) in order to determine what these CAFs correspond to.</p>    <h2 id="index-1">7.2.

Restrictions are specified as follows:</p> <dl class="rts-flag"> <dt>

</dl>   <h3 id="retainer-prof">7.4.2. Retainer Profiling</h3> <p id="retainer-profiling">Retainer profiling is designed to help answer questions like “why is this data being retained?”. We start by defining what we mean by a retainer:</p>  A retainer is either the system stack, an unevaluated closure (thunk), or an explicitly mutable object. <p>In particular, constructors are <em>not</em> retainers.</p> <p>An object <code>B</code> retains object <code>A</code> if (i) <code>B</code> is a retainer object and (ii) object <code>A</code> can be reached by recursively following pointers starting from object <code>B</code>, but not meeting any other retainer objects on the way. Each live object is retained by one or more retainer objects, collectively called its retainer set, or its retainer set, or its retainers.</p> <p>When retainer profiling is requested by giving the program the <code>-hr</code> option, a graph is generated which is broken down by retainer set. A retainer set is displayed as a set of cost-centre stacks; because this is usually too large to fit on the profile graph, each retainer set is numbered and shown abbreviated on the graph along with its number, and the full list of retainer sets is dumped into the file <code>prog.prof</code>.</p> <p>Retainer profiling requires multiple passes over the live heap in order to discover the full retainer set for each object, which can be quite slow. So we set a limit on the maximum size of a retainer set, where all retainer sets larger than the maximum retainer set size are replaced by the special set <code>MANY</code>. The maximum set size defaults to 8 and can be altered with the <a class="reference internal" href="#rts-flag--R"><code>-R</code></a> RTS option:</p> <dl class="rts-flag"> <dt id="rts-flag--R">
<code>-R⟨size⟩</code> </dt> <dd>
<p>Restrict the number of elements in a retainer set to ⟨size⟩ (default 8).</p> </dd>
</dl>  <h4 id="hints-for-using-retainer-profiling">7.4.2.1. Hints for using retainer profiling</h4> <p>The definition of retainers is designed to reflect a common cause of space leaks: a large structure is retained by an unevaluated computation, and will be released once the computation is forced. A good example is looking up a value in a finite map, where unless the lookup is forced in a timely manner the unevaluated lookup will cause the whole mapping to be retained. These kind of space leaks can often be eliminated by forcing the relevant computations to be performed eagerly, using <code>seq</code> or strictness annotations on data constructor fields.</p> <p>Often a particular data structure is being retained by a chain of unevaluated closures, only the nearest of which will be reported by retainer profiling - for example <code>A</code> retains <code>B</code>, <code>B</code> retains <code>C</code>, and <code>C</code> retains a large structure. There might be a large number of <code>B</code>s but only a single <code>A</code>, so <code>A</code> is really the one we’re interested in eliminating. However, retainer profiling will in this case report <code>B</code> as the retainer of the large structure. To move further up the chain of retainers, we can ask for another retainer profile but this time restrict the profile to <code>B</code> objects, so we get a profile of the retainers of <code>B</code>:</p> <pre data-language="none">prog +RTS -hr -hcB
</pre> <p>This trick isn’t foolproof, because there might be other <code>B</code> closures in the heap which aren’t the retainers we are interested in, but we’ve found this to be a useful technique in most cases.</p>    <h3 id="biography-prof">7.4.3. Biographical Profiling</h3> <p id="biographical-profiling">A typical heap object may be in one of the following four states at each point in its lifetime:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>The lag stage, which is the time between creation and the first use of the object,</li> <li>the use stage, which lasts from the first use until the last use of the object, and</li> <li>The drag stage, which lasts from the final use until the last reference to the object is dropped.</li> <li>An object which is never used is said to be in the void state for its whole lifetime.</li> </ul> <p>A biographical heap profile displays the portion of the live heap in each of the four states listed above. Usually the most interesting states are the void and drag states: live heap in these states is more likely to be wasted space than heap in the lag or use states.</p> <p>It is also possible to break down the heap in one or more of these states by a different criteria, by restricting a profile by biography. For example, to show the portion of the heap in the drag or void state by producer:</p> <pre data-language="none">prog +RTS -hc -hbdrag,void
</pre> <p>Once you know the producer or the type of the heap in the drag or void states, the next step is usually to find the retainer(s):</p> <pre data-language="none">prog +RTS -hr -hccc...

Actual memory residency</h3> <p id="actual-memory-residency">How does the heap residency reported by the heap profiler relate to the actual memory residency of your program when you run it? You might see a large discrepancy between the residency reported by the heap profiler, and the residency reported by tools on your system (eg. <code>ps</code> or <code>top</code> on Unix, or the Task Manager on Windows). There are several reasons for this:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>There is an overhead of profiling itself, which is subtracted from the residency figures by the profiler. This overhead goes away when compiling without profiling support, of course. The space overhead is currently 2 extra words per heap object, which probably results in about a 30% overhead.</li> <li>Garbage collection requires more memory than the actual residency. The factor depends on the kind of garbage collection algorithm in use: a major GC in the standard generation copying collector will usually require 3L bytes of memory, where L is the amount of live data. This is because by default (see the RTS <a class="reference internal" href="../runtime_control/#rts-flag--F"><code>-F</code></a> option) we allow the old generation to grow to twice its size (2L) before collecting it, and we require additionally L bytes to copy the live data into. When using compacting collection (see the <a class="reference internal" href="../runtime_control/#rts-flag--c"><code>-c</code></a> option), this is reduced to 2L, and can further be reduced by tweaking the <a class="reference internal" href="../runtime_control/#rts-flag--F"><code>-F</code></a> option. Also add the size of the allocation area (currently a fixed 512Kb).</li> <li>The stack isn’t counted in the heap profile by default. See the RTS <a class="reference internal" href="#rts-flag--xt"><code>-xt</code></a> option.</li> <li>The program text itself, the C stack, any non-heap data (e.g. data allocated by foreign libraries, and data allocated by the RTS), and <code>mmap()</code>‘d memory are not counted in the heap profile.</li> </ul>    <h2 id="hp2ps">7.5. <code>hp2ps</code> – Rendering heap profiles to PostScript</h2> <p id="hp2ps-rendering-heap-profiles-to-postscript">Usage:</p> <pre data-language="none">hp2ps [flags] [&lt;file&gt;[.hp]]
</pre> <p>The program <strong class="command">hp2ps</strong> program converts a heap profile as produced by the <code>-h&lt;break-down&gt;</code> runtime option into a PostScript graph of the heap profile. By convention, the file to be processed by <strong class="command">hp2ps</strong> has a <code>.hp</code> extension. The PostScript output is written to <code><em>file</em>@.ps</code>. If <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> is omitted entirely, then the program behaves as a filter.</p> <p><strong class="command">hp2ps</strong> is distributed in <code>ghc/utils/hp2ps</code> in a GHC source distribution. It was originally developed by Dave Wakeling as part of the HBC/LML heap profiler.</p> <p>The flags are:</p> <dl class="option"> <dt id="cmdoption-hp2ps-d">
<code>-d</code> </dt> <dd>
<p>In order to make graphs more readable, <code>hp2ps</code> sorts the shaded bands for each identifier. The default sort ordering is for the bands with the largest area to be stacked on top of the smaller ones. The <code>-d</code> option causes rougher bands (those representing series of values with the largest standard deviations) to be stacked on top of smoother ones.</p> </dd>
</dl> <dl class="option"> <dt id="cmdoption-hp2ps-b">
<code>-b</code> </dt> <dd>
<p>Normally, <code>hp2ps</code> puts the title of the graph in a small box at the top of the page. However, if the JOB string is too long to fit in a small box (more than 35 characters), then <code>hp2ps</code> will choose to use a big box instead. The <code>-b</code> option forces <code>hp2ps</code> to use a big box.</p> </dd>

This format is convenient of studying the graph in detail, but it is unsuitable for inclusion in LaTeX documents. The <code>-e</code> option causes the graph to be drawn in portrait mode, with float specifying the width in inches, millimetres or points (the default).

In principle, running <strong class="command">hp2ps</strong> on the incomplete file should produce a snapshot of your program’s heap usage. However, the last sample in the file may be incomplete, causing <strong class="command">hp2ps</strong> to fail.

We then select the line number of the last complete sample using <strong class="command">tail</strong> and <strong class="command">cut</strong>. This is used as a parameter to <strong class="command">head</strong>; the result is as if we deleted the final incomplete sample from <code>FOO.hp</code>.

</pre> <p>If you forget the <code>-watch</code> flag you can still select “Watch file” from the “State” menu. Now each time you generate a new profile <code>FOO.ps</code> the view will update automatically.</p> <p>This can all be encapsulated in a little script:</p> <pre data-language="sh">#!/bin/sh

In the current implementation, a profiled program is likely to scale much less well than the unprofiled program, because the profiling implementation uses some shared data structures which require locking in the runtime system. Furthermore, the memory allocation statistics collected by the profiled program are stored in shared memory but <em>not</em> locked (for speed), which means that these figures might be inaccurate for parallel programs.</p> <p>We strongly recommend that you use <a class="reference internal" href="#ghc-flag--fno-prof-count-entries"><code>-fno-prof-count-entries</code></a> when compiling a program to be profiled on multiple cores, because the entry counts are also stored in shared memory, and continuously updating them on multiple cores is extremely slow.</p> <p>We also recommend using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/ThreadScope" target="_blank">ThreadScope</a> for profiling parallel programs; it offers a GUI for visualising parallel execution, and is complementary to the time and space profiling features provided with GHC.</p>   <h2 id="hpc">7.7. Observing Code Coverage</h2> <p id="observing-code-coverage">Code coverage tools allow a programmer to determine what parts of their code have been actually executed, and which parts have never actually been invoked.

HPC tools can be used to render the generated code coverage information into human understandable format.</p> <p>Correctly instrumented code provides coverage information of two kinds: source coverage and boolean-control coverage. Source coverage is the extent to which every part of the program was used, measured at three different levels: declarations (both top-level and local), alternatives (among several equations or case branches) and expressions (at every level). Boolean coverage is the extent to which each of the values True and False is obtained in every syntactic boolean context (ie. guard, condition, qualifier).</p> <p>HPC displays both kinds of information in two primary ways: textual reports with summary statistics (<code>hpc report</code>) and sources with color mark-up (<code>hpc markup</code>). For boolean coverage, there are four possible outcomes for each guard, condition or qualifier: both True and False values occur; only True; only False; never evaluated. In hpc-markup output, highlighting with a yellow background indicates a part of the program that was never evaluated; a green background indicates an always-True expression and a red background indicates an always-False one.</p>  <h3 id="a-small-example-reciprocation">7.7.1.

</pre> <p>GHC creates a subdirectory <code>.hpc</code> in the current directory, and puts HPC index (<code>.mix</code>) files in there, one for each module compiled.

</pre> <p>Running the program generates a file with the <code>.tix</code> suffix, in this case <code>Recip.tix</code>, which contains the coverage data for this run of the program. The program may be run multiple times (e.g. with different test data), and the coverage data from the separate runs is accumulated in the <code>.tix</code> file. To reset the coverage data and start again, just remove the <code>.tix</code> file.</p> <p>Having run the program, we can generate a textual summary of coverage:</p> <pre data-language="none">$ hpc report Recip
 80% expressions used (81/101)
