<h1 class="SECT1" id="VIEW-PG-LOCKS">49.63. pg_locks</h1> <p>The view <code class="STRUCTNAME">pg_locks</code> provides access to information about the locks held by open transactions within the database server. See <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/mvcc.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a> for more discussion of locking.</p> <p><code class="STRUCTNAME">pg_locks</code> contains one row per active lockable object, requested lock mode, and relevant transaction. Thus, the same lockable object might appear many times, if multiple transactions are holding or waiting for locks on it. However, an object that currently has no locks on it will not appear at all.</p> <p>There are several distinct types of lockable objects: whole relations (e.g., tables), individual pages of relations, individual tuples of relations, transaction IDs (both virtual and permanent IDs), and general database objects (identified by class OID and object OID, in the same way as in <code class="STRUCTNAME">pg_description</code> or <code class="STRUCTNAME">pg_depend</code>). Also, the right to extend a relation is represented as a separate lockable object. Also, <span class="QUOTE">"advisory"</span> locks can be taken on numbers that have user-defined meanings.</p> <div class="TABLE" id="AEN107180">  <p class="c2">Table 49-64. <code class="STRUCTNAME">pg_locks</code> Columns</p> <table class="CALSTABLE"> <col> <col> <col> <col> <thead> <tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Type</th> <th>References</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code class="STRUCTFIELD">locktype</code></td> <td><code class="TYPE">text</code></td> <td> </td> <td>Type of the lockable object: <code class="LITERAL">relation</code>, <code class="LITERAL">extend</code>, <code class="LITERAL">page</code>, <code class="LITERAL">tuple</code>, <code class="LITERAL">transactionid</code>, <code class="LITERAL">virtualxid</code>, <code class="LITERAL">object</code>, <code class="LITERAL">userlock</code>, or <code class="LITERAL">advisory</code>

False indicates that this transaction is currently waiting to acquire this lock, which implies that some other transaction is holding a conflicting lock mode on the same lockable object. The waiting transaction will sleep until the other lock is released (or a deadlock situation is detected). A single transaction can be waiting to acquire at most one lock at a time.</p> <p>Every transaction holds an exclusive lock on its virtual transaction ID for its entire duration. If a permanent ID is assigned to the transaction (which normally happens only if the transaction changes the state of the database), it also holds an exclusive lock on its permanent transaction ID until it ends. When one transaction finds it necessary to wait specifically for another transaction, it does so by attempting to acquire share lock on the other transaction ID (either virtual or permanent ID depending on the situation). That will succeed only when the other transaction terminates and releases its locks.</p> <p>Although tuples are a lockable type of object, information about row-level locks is stored on disk, not in memory, and therefore row-level locks normally do not appear in this view. If a transaction is waiting for a row-level lock, it will usually appear in the view as waiting for the permanent transaction ID of the current holder of that row lock.</p> <p>Advisory locks can be acquired on keys consisting of either a single <code class="TYPE">bigint</code> value or two integer values. A <code class="TYPE">bigint</code> key is displayed with its high-order half in the <code class="STRUCTFIELD">classid</code> column, its low-order half in the <code class="STRUCTFIELD">objid</code> column, and <code class="STRUCTFIELD">objsubid</code> equal to 1. The original <code class="TYPE">bigint</code> value can be reassembled with the expression <code class="LITERAL">(classid::bigint &lt;&lt; 32) | objid::bigint</code>. Integer keys are displayed with the first key in the <code class="STRUCTFIELD">classid</code> column, the second key in the <code class="STRUCTFIELD">objid</code> column, and <code class="STRUCTFIELD">objsubid</code> equal to 2. The actual meaning of the keys is up to the user. Advisory locks are local to each database, so the <code class="STRUCTFIELD">database</code> column is meaningful for an advisory lock.</p> <p><code class="STRUCTNAME">pg_locks</code> provides a global view of all locks in the database cluster, not only those relevant to the current database. Although its <code class="STRUCTFIELD">relation</code> column can be joined against <code class="STRUCTNAME">pg_class</code>.<code class="STRUCTFIELD">oid</code> to identify locked relations, this will only work correctly for relations in the current database (those for which the <code class="STRUCTFIELD">database</code> column is either the current database's OID or zero).</p> <p>The <code class="STRUCTFIELD">pid</code> column can be joined to the <code class="STRUCTFIELD">pid</code> column of the <a href="../monitoring-stats/#PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW"><code class="STRUCTNAME">pg_stat_activity</code></a> view to get more information on the session holding or waiting to hold each lock, for example</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT * FROM pg_locks pl LEFT JOIN pg_stat_activity psa
    ON pl.pid = psa.pid;
</pre> <p>Also, if you are using prepared transactions, the <code class="STRUCTFIELD">virtualtransaction</code> column can be joined to the <code class="STRUCTFIELD">transaction</code> column of the <a href="../view-pg-prepared-xacts/"><code class="STRUCTNAME">pg_prepared_xacts</code></a> view to get more information on prepared transactions that hold locks. (A prepared transaction can never be waiting for a lock, but it continues to hold the locks it acquired while running.) For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT * FROM pg_locks pl LEFT JOIN pg_prepared_xacts ppx
    ON pl.virtualtransaction = '-1/' || ppx.transaction;
</pre> <p>The <code class="STRUCTNAME">pg_locks</code> view displays data from both the regular lock manager and the predicate lock manager, which are separate systems; in addition, the regular lock manager subdivides its locks into regular and <i class="FIRSTTERM">fast-path</i> locks. This data is not guaranteed to be entirely consistent. When the view is queried, data on fast-path locks (with <code class="STRUCTFIELD">fastpath</code> = <code class="LITERAL">true</code>) is gathered from each backend one at a time, without freezing the state of the entire lock manager, so it is possible for locks to be taken or released while information is gathered. Note, however, that these locks are known not to conflict with any other lock currently in place. After all backends have been queried for fast-path locks, the remainder of the regular lock manager is locked as a unit, and a consistent snapshot of all remaining locks is collected as an atomic action. After unlocking the regular lock manager, the predicate lock manager is similarly locked and all predicate locks are collected as an atomic action. Thus, with the exception of fast-path locks, each lock manager will deliver a consistent set of results, but as we do not lock both lock managers simultaneously, it is possible for locks to be taken or released after we interrogate the regular lock manager and before we interrogate the predicate lock manager.</p> <p>Locking the regular and/or predicate lock manager could have some impact on database performance if this view is very frequently accessed. The locks are held only for the minimum amount of time necessary to obtain data from the lock managers, but this does not completely eliminate the possibility of a performance impact.</p>  <div class="NAVFOOTER">  <table summary="Footer navigation table"> <tr> <td width="33%" align="left"><a href="../view-pg-indexes/" accesskey="P">Prev</a></td> <td width="34%" align="center"></td> <td width="33%" align="right"><a href="../view-pg-matviews/" accesskey="N">Next</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="33%" align="left"><code class="STRUCTNAME">pg_indexes</code></td> <td width="34%" align="center"><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/catalogs.html" accesskey="U" target="_blank">Up</a></td> <td width="33%" align="right"><code class="STRUCTNAME">pg_matviews</code></td> </tr> </table> </div>
