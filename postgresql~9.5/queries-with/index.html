<h1 class="SECT1" id="QUERIES-WITH">7.8. WITH Queries (Common Table Expressions)</h1> <p><code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> provides a way to write auxiliary statements for use in a larger query. These statements, which are often referred to as Common Table Expressions or <acronym class="ACRONYM">CTE</acronym>s, can be thought of as defining temporary tables that exist just for one query. Each auxiliary statement in a <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> clause can be a <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code>, <code class="COMMAND">INSERT</code>, <code class="COMMAND">UPDATE</code>, or <code class="COMMAND">DELETE</code>; and the <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> clause itself is attached to a primary statement that can also be a <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code>, <code class="COMMAND">INSERT</code>, <code class="COMMAND">UPDATE</code>, or <code class="COMMAND">DELETE</code>.</p> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="QUERIES-WITH-SELECT">7.8.1. <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code> in <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code>
</h2> <p>The basic value of <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code> in <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> is to break down complicated queries into simpler parts. An example is:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
WITH regional_sales AS (
        SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
        FROM orders
        GROUP BY region
     ), top_regions AS (
        SELECT region
        FROM regional_sales
        WHERE total_sales &gt; (SELECT SUM(total_sales)/10 FROM regional_sales)
     )
SELECT region,
       product,
       SUM(quantity) AS product_units,
       SUM(amount) AS product_sales
FROM orders
WHERE region IN (SELECT region FROM top_regions)
GROUP BY region, product;
</pre> <p>which displays per-product sales totals in only the top sales regions. The <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> clause defines two auxiliary statements named <code class="STRUCTNAME">regional_sales</code> and <code class="STRUCTNAME">top_regions</code>, where the output of <code class="STRUCTNAME">regional_sales</code> is used in <code class="STRUCTNAME">top_regions</code> and the output of <code class="STRUCTNAME">top_regions</code> is used in the primary <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code> query. This example could have been written without <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code>, but we'd have needed two levels of nested sub-<code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code>s. It's a bit easier to follow this way.</p> <p>The optional <code class="LITERAL">RECURSIVE</code> modifier changes <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> from a mere syntactic convenience into a feature that accomplishes things not otherwise possible in standard SQL. Using <code class="LITERAL">RECURSIVE</code>, a <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> query can refer to its own output. A very simple example is this query to sum the integers from 1 through 100:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
WITH RECURSIVE t(n) AS (
    VALUES (1)
  UNION ALL
    SELECT n+1 FROM t WHERE n &lt; 100
)
SELECT sum(n) FROM t;
</pre> <p>The general form of a recursive <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> query is always a <i class="FIRSTTERM">non-recursive term</i>, then <code class="LITERAL">UNION</code> (or <code class="LITERAL">UNION ALL</code>), then a <i class="FIRSTTERM">recursive term</i>, where only the recursive term can contain a reference to the query's own output. Such a query is executed as follows:</p> <div class="PROCEDURE"> <p class="c2">Recursive Query Evaluation</p> <ol type="1"> <li class="STEP"> <p>Evaluate the non-recursive term. For <code class="LITERAL">UNION</code> (but not <code class="LITERAL">UNION ALL</code>), discard duplicate rows. Include all remaining rows in the result of the recursive query, and also place them in a temporary <i class="FIRSTTERM">working table</i>.</p> </li> <li class="STEP"> <p>So long as the working table is not empty, repeat these steps:</p> <ol class="SUBSTEPS" type="a"> <li class="STEP"> <p>Evaluate the recursive term, substituting the current contents of the working table for the recursive self-reference. For <code class="LITERAL">UNION</code> (but not <code class="LITERAL">UNION ALL</code>), discard duplicate rows and rows that duplicate any previous result row. Include all remaining rows in the result of the recursive query, and also place them in a temporary <i class="FIRSTTERM">intermediate table</i>.</p> </li> <li class="STEP"> <p>Replace the contents of the working table with the contents of the intermediate table, then empty the intermediate table.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> </div>  <blockquote class="NOTE"> <p><b>Note:</b> Strictly speaking, this process is iteration not recursion, but <code class="LITERAL">RECURSIVE</code> is the terminology chosen by the SQL standards committee.</p> </blockquote>  <p>In the example above, the working table has just a single row in each step, and it takes on the values from 1 through 100 in successive steps. In the 100th step, there is no output because of the <code class="LITERAL">WHERE</code> clause, and so the query terminates.</p> <p>Recursive queries are typically used to deal with hierarchical or tree-structured data. A useful example is this query to find all the direct and indirect sub-parts of a product, given only a table that shows immediate inclusions:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
WITH RECURSIVE included_parts(sub_part, part, quantity) AS (
    SELECT sub_part, part, quantity FROM parts WHERE part = 'our_product'
  UNION ALL
    SELECT p.sub_part, p.part, p.quantity
    FROM included_parts pr, parts p
    WHERE p.part = pr.sub_part
  )
SELECT sub_part, SUM(quantity) as total_quantity
FROM included_parts
GROUP BY sub_part
</pre> <p>When working with recursive queries it is important to be sure that the recursive part of the query will eventually return no tuples, or else the query will loop indefinitely. Sometimes, using <code class="LITERAL">UNION</code> instead of <code class="LITERAL">UNION ALL</code> can accomplish this by discarding rows that duplicate previous output rows. However, often a cycle does not involve output rows that are completely duplicate: it may be necessary to check just one or a few fields to see if the same point has been reached before. The standard method for handling such situations is to compute an array of the already-visited values. For example, consider the following query that searches a table <code class="STRUCTNAME">graph</code> using a <code class="STRUCTFIELD">link</code> field:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
WITH RECURSIVE search_graph(id, link, data, depth) AS (
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 1
        FROM graph g
      UNION ALL
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1
        FROM graph g, search_graph sg
        WHERE g.id = sg.link
)
SELECT * FROM search_graph;
</pre> <p>This query will loop if the <code class="STRUCTFIELD">link</code> relationships contain cycles. Because we require a <span class="QUOTE">"depth"</span> output, just changing <code class="LITERAL">UNION ALL</code> to <code class="LITERAL">UNION</code> would not eliminate the looping. Instead we need to recognize whether we have reached the same row again while following a particular path of links. We add two columns <code class="STRUCTFIELD">path</code> and <code class="STRUCTFIELD">cycle</code> to the loop-prone query:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
WITH RECURSIVE search_graph(id, link, data, depth, path, cycle) AS (
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 1,
          ARRAY[g.id],
          false
        FROM graph g
      UNION ALL
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1,
          path || g.id,
          g.id = ANY(path)
        FROM graph g, search_graph sg
        WHERE g.id = sg.link AND NOT cycle
)
SELECT * FROM search_graph;
</pre> <p>Aside from preventing cycles, the array value is often useful in its own right as representing the <span class="QUOTE">"path"</span> taken to reach any particular row.</p> <p>In the general case where more than one field needs to be checked to recognize a cycle, use an array of rows. For example, if we needed to compare fields <code class="STRUCTFIELD">f1</code> and <code class="STRUCTFIELD">f2</code>:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
WITH RECURSIVE search_graph(id, link, data, depth, path, cycle) AS (
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 1,
          ARRAY[ROW(g.f1, g.f2)],
          false
        FROM graph g
      UNION ALL
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1,
          path || ROW(g.f1, g.f2),
          ROW(g.f1, g.f2) = ANY(path)
        FROM graph g, search_graph sg
        WHERE g.id = sg.link AND NOT cycle
)
SELECT * FROM search_graph;
</pre> <div class="TIP"> <blockquote class="TIP"> <p><b>Tip:</b> Omit the <code class="LITERAL">ROW()</code> syntax in the common case where only one field needs to be checked to recognize a cycle. This allows a simple array rather than a composite-type array to be used, gaining efficiency.</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="TIP"> <blockquote class="TIP"> <p><b>Tip:</b> The recursive query evaluation algorithm produces its output in breadth-first search order. You can display the results in depth-first search order by making the outer query <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> a <span class="QUOTE">"path"</span> column constructed in this way.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>A helpful trick for testing queries when you are not certain if they might loop is to place a <code class="LITERAL">LIMIT</code> in the parent query. For example, this query would loop forever without the <code class="LITERAL">LIMIT</code>:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
WITH RECURSIVE t(n) AS (
    SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
    SELECT n+1 FROM t
)
SELECT n FROM t LIMIT 100;
</pre> <p>This works because <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span>'s implementation evaluates only as many rows of a <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> query as are actually fetched by the parent query. Using this trick in production is not recommended, because other systems might work differently. Also, it usually won't work if you make the outer query sort the recursive query's results or join them to some other table, because in such cases the outer query will usually try to fetch all of the <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> query's output anyway.</p> <p>A useful property of <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> queries is that they are evaluated only once per execution of the parent query, even if they are referred to more than once by the parent query or sibling <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> queries. Thus, expensive calculations that are needed in multiple places can be placed within a <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> query to avoid redundant work. Another possible application is to prevent unwanted multiple evaluations of functions with side-effects. However, the other side of this coin is that the optimizer is less able to push restrictions from the parent query down into a <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> query than an ordinary subquery. The <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> query will generally be evaluated as written, without suppression of rows that the parent query might discard afterwards. (But, as mentioned above, evaluation might stop early if the reference(s) to the query demand only a limited number of rows.)</p> <p>The examples above only show <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> being used with <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code>, but it can be attached in the same way to <code class="COMMAND">INSERT</code>, <code class="COMMAND">UPDATE</code>, or <code class="COMMAND">DELETE</code>. In each case it effectively provides temporary table(s) that can be referred to in the main command.</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="QUERIES-WITH-MODIFYING">7.8.2. Data-Modifying Statements in <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code>
</h2> <p>You can use data-modifying statements (<code class="COMMAND">INSERT</code>, <code class="COMMAND">UPDATE</code>, or <code class="COMMAND">DELETE</code>) in <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code>. This allows you to perform several different operations in the same query. An example is:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
WITH moved_rows AS (
    DELETE FROM products
    WHERE
        "date" &gt;= '2010-10-01' AND
        "date" &lt; '2010-11-01'
    RETURNING *
)
INSERT INTO products_log
SELECT * FROM moved_rows;
</pre> <p>This query effectively moves rows from <code class="STRUCTNAME">products</code> to <code class="STRUCTNAME">products_log</code>. The <code class="COMMAND">DELETE</code> in <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> deletes the specified rows from <code class="STRUCTNAME">products</code>, returning their contents by means of its <code class="LITERAL">RETURNING</code> clause; and then the primary query reads that output and inserts it into <code class="STRUCTNAME">products_log</code>.</p> <p>A fine point of the above example is that the <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> clause is attached to the <code class="COMMAND">INSERT</code>, not the sub-<code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code> within the <code class="COMMAND">INSERT</code>. This is necessary because data-modifying statements are only allowed in <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> clauses that are attached to the top-level statement. However, normal <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> visibility rules apply, so it is possible to refer to the <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> statement's output from the sub-<code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code>.</p> <p>Data-modifying statements in <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> usually have <code class="LITERAL">RETURNING</code> clauses (see <a href="../dml-returning/">Section 6.4</a>), as shown in the example above. It is the output of the <code class="LITERAL">RETURNING</code> clause, <span class="emphasis EMPHASIS c3">not</span> the target table of the data-modifying statement, that forms the temporary table that can be referred to by the rest of the query. If a data-modifying statement in <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> lacks a <code class="LITERAL">RETURNING</code> clause, then it forms no temporary table and cannot be referred to in the rest of the query. Such a statement will be executed nonetheless. A not-particularly-useful example is:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
WITH t AS (
    DELETE FROM foo
)
DELETE FROM bar;
</pre> <p>This example would remove all rows from tables <code class="STRUCTNAME">foo</code> and <code class="STRUCTNAME">bar</code>. The number of affected rows reported to the client would only include rows removed from <code class="STRUCTNAME">bar</code>.</p> <p>Recursive self-references in data-modifying statements are not allowed. In some cases it is possible to work around this limitation by referring to the output of a recursive <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code>, for example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
WITH RECURSIVE included_parts(sub_part, part) AS (
    SELECT sub_part, part FROM parts WHERE part = 'our_product'
  UNION ALL
    SELECT p.sub_part, p.part
    FROM included_parts pr, parts p
    WHERE p.part = pr.sub_part
  )
DELETE FROM parts
  WHERE part IN (SELECT part FROM included_parts);
</pre> <p>This query would remove all direct and indirect subparts of a product.</p> <p>Data-modifying statements in <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> are executed exactly once, and always to completion, independently of whether the primary query reads all (or indeed any) of their output. Notice that this is different from the rule for <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code> in <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code>: as stated in the previous section, execution of a <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code> is carried only as far as the primary query demands its output.</p> <p>The sub-statements in <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> are executed concurrently with each other and with the main query. Therefore, when using data-modifying statements in <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code>, the order in which the specified updates actually happen is unpredictable. All the statements are executed with the same <i class="FIRSTTERM">snapshot</i> (see <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/mvcc.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a>), so they cannot <span class="QUOTE">"see"</span> one another's effects on the target tables. This alleviates the effects of the unpredictability of the actual order of row updates, and means that <code class="LITERAL">RETURNING</code> data is the only way to communicate changes between different <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> sub-statements and the main query. An example of this is that in</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
WITH t AS (
    UPDATE products SET price = price * 1.05
    RETURNING *
)
SELECT * FROM products;
</pre> <p>the outer <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code> would return the original prices before the action of the <code class="COMMAND">UPDATE</code>, while in</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
WITH t AS (
    UPDATE products SET price = price * 1.05
    RETURNING *
)
SELECT * FROM t;
</pre> <p>the outer <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code> would return the updated data.</p> <p>Trying to update the same row twice in a single statement is not supported. Only one of the modifications takes place, but it is not easy (and sometimes not possible) to reliably predict which one. This also applies to deleting a row that was already updated in the same statement: only the update is performed. Therefore you should generally avoid trying to modify a single row twice in a single statement. In particular avoid writing <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> sub-statements that could affect the same rows changed by the main statement or a sibling sub-statement. The effects of such a statement will not be predictable.</p> <p>At present, any table used as the target of a data-modifying statement in <code class="LITERAL">WITH</code> must not have a conditional rule, nor an <code class="LITERAL">ALSO</code> rule, nor an <code class="LITERAL">INSTEAD</code> rule that expands to multiple statements.</p> </div>  <div class="NAVFOOTER">  <table summary="Footer navigation table"> <tr> <td width="33%" align="left"><a href="../queries-values/" accesskey="P">Prev</a></td> <td width="34%" align="center"></td> <td width="33%" align="right"><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/datatype.html" accesskey="N" target="_blank">Next</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="33%" align="left">
