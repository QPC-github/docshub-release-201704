<h1>Understand images, containers, and storage drivers</h1>  <p>To use storage drivers effectively, you must understand how Docker builds and stores images. Then, you need an understanding of how these images are used by containers. Finally, you’ll need a short introduction to the technologies that enable both images and container operations.</p> <h2 id="images-and-layers">Images and layers</h2> <p>Each Docker image references a list of read-only layers that represent filesystem differences. Layers are stacked on top of each other to form a base for a container’s root filesystem. The diagram below shows the Ubuntu 15.04 image comprising 4 stacked image layers.</p> <p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/image-layers.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>The Docker storage driver is responsible for stacking these layers and providing a single unified view.</p> <p>When you create a new container, you add a new, thin, writable layer on top of the underlying stack. This layer is often called the “container layer”. All changes made to the running container - such as writing new files, modifying existing files, and deleting files - are written to this thin writable container layer. The diagram below shows a container based on the Ubuntu 15.04 image.</p> <p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/container-layers.jpg" alt=""></p> <h3 id="content-addressable-storage">Content addressable storage</h3> <p>Docker 1.10 introduced a new content addressable storage model. This is a completely new way to address image and layer data on disk. Previously, image and layer data was referenced and stored using a randomly generated UUID. In the new model this is replaced by a secure <em>content hash</em>.</p> <p>The new model improves security, provides a built-in way to avoid ID collisions, and guarantees data integrity after pull, push, load, and save operations. It also enables better sharing of layers by allowing many images to freely share their layers even if they didn’t come from the same build.</p> <p>The diagram below shows an updated version of the previous diagram, highlighting the changes implemented by Docker 1.10.</p> <p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/container-layers-cas.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>As can be seen, all image layer IDs are cryptographic hashes, whereas the container ID is still a randomly generated UUID.</p> <p>There are several things to note regarding the new model. These include:</p> <ol> <li>Migration of existing images</li> <li>Image and layer filesystem structures</li> </ol> <p>Existing images, those created and pulled by earlier versions of Docker, need to be migrated before they can be used with the new model. This migration involves calculating new secure checksums and is performed automatically the first time you start an updated Docker daemon. After the migration is complete, all images and tags will have brand new secure IDs.</p> <p>Although the migration is automatic and transparent, it is computationally intensive. This means it can take time if you have lots of image data. During this time your Docker daemon will not respond to other requests.</p> <p>A migration tool exists that allows you to migrate existing images to the new format before upgrading your Docker daemon. This means that upgraded Docker daemons do not need to perform the migration in-band, and therefore avoids any associated downtime. It also provides a way to manually migrate existing images so that they can be distributed to other Docker daemons in your environment that are already running the latest versions of Docker.</p> <p>The migration tool is provided by Docker, Inc., and runs as a container. You can download it from <a href="https://github.com/docker/v1.10-migrator/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/docker/v1.10-migrator/releases</a>.</p> <p>While running the “migrator” image you need to expose your Docker host’s data directory to the container. If you are using the default Docker data path, the command to run the container will look like this</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ sudo docker run --rm -v /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker docker/v1.10-migrator
</pre>  <p>If you use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">devicemapper</code> storage driver, you will need to include the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--privileged</code> option so that the container has access to your storage devices.</p> <h4 id="migration-example">Migration example</h4> <p>The following example shows the migration tool in use on a Docker host running version 1.9.1 of the Docker daemon and the AUFS storage driver. The Docker host is running on a <strong>t2.micro</strong> AWS EC2 instance with 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, and a single 8GB general purpose SSD EBS volume. The Docker data directory (<code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/lib/docker</code>) was consuming 2GB of space.</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ docker images

</pre>  <p>The Unix <code class="highlighter-rouge">time</code> command prepends the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker run</code> command to produce timings for the operation. As can be seen, the overall time taken to migrate 7 images comprising 2GB of disk space took approximately 1 minute. However, this included the time taken to pull the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker/v1.10-migrator</code> image (approximately 3.5 seconds). The same operation on an m4.10xlarge EC2 instance with 40 vCPUs, 160GB RAM and an 8GB provisioned IOPS EBS volume resulted in the following improved timings:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="">real    0m9.871s

</pre>  <p>This shows that the migration operation is affected by the hardware spec of the machine performing the migration.</p> <h2 id="container-and-layers">Container and layers</h2> <p>The major difference between a container and an image is the top writable layer. All writes to the container that add new or modify existing data are stored in this writable layer. When the container is deleted the writable layer is also deleted. The underlying image remains unchanged.</p> <p>Because each container has its own thin writable container layer, and all changes are stored in this container layer, this means that multiple containers can share access to the same underlying image and yet have their own data state. The diagram below shows multiple containers sharing the same Ubuntu 15.04 image.</p> <p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/sharing-layers.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>The Docker storage driver is responsible for enabling and managing both the image layers and the writable container layer. How a storage driver accomplishes these can vary between drivers. Two key technologies behind Docker image and container management are stackable image layers and copy-on-write (CoW).</p> <h2 id="the-copy-on-write-strategy">The copy-on-write strategy</h2> <p>Sharing is a good way to optimize resources. People do this instinctively in daily life. For example, twins Jane and Joseph taking an Algebra class at different times from different teachers can share the same exercise book by passing it between each other. Now, suppose Jane gets an assignment to complete the homework on page 11 in the book. At that point, Jane copies page 11, completes the homework, and hands in her copy. The original exercise book is unchanged and only Jane has a copy of the changed page 11.</p> <p>Copy-on-write is a similar strategy of sharing and copying. In this strategy, system processes that need the same data share the same instance of that data rather than having their own copy. At some point, if one process needs to modify or write to the data, only then does the operating system make a copy of the data for that process to use. Only the process that needs to write has access to the data copy. All the other processes continue to use the original data.</p> <p>Docker uses a copy-on-write technology with both images and containers. This CoW strategy optimizes both image disk space usage and the performance of container start times. The next sections look at how copy-on-write is leveraged with images and containers through sharing and copying.</p> <h3 id="sharing-promotes-smaller-images">Sharing promotes smaller images</h3> <p>This section looks at image layers and copy-on-write technology. All image and container layers exist inside the Docker host’s <em>local storage area</em> and are managed by the storage driver. On Linux-based Docker hosts this is usually located under <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/lib/docker/</code>.</p> <p>The Docker client reports on image layers when instructed to pull and push images with <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker pull</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker push</code>. The command below pulls the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ubuntu:15.04</code> Docker image from Docker Hub.</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ docker pull ubuntu:15.04

</pre>  <p>See how the four directories do not match up with the image layer IDs pulled in the previous step.</p> <p>Despite the differences between image management before and after version 1.10, all versions of Docker still allow images to share layers. For example, If you <code class="highlighter-rouge">pull</code> an image that shares some of the same image layers as an image that has already been pulled, the Docker daemon recognizes this, and only pulls the layers it doesn’t already have stored locally. After the second pull, the two images will share any common image layers.</p> <p>You can illustrate this now for yourself. Starting with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ubuntu:15.04</code> image that you just pulled, make a change to it, and build a new image based on the change. One way to do this is using a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code> and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker build</code> command.</p> <ol> <li> <p>In an empty directory, create a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code> that starts with the ubuntu:15.04 image.</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language=""> FROM ubuntu:15.04
</pre>  </li> <li> <p>Add a new file called “newfile” in the image’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">/tmp</code> directory with the text “Hello world” in it.</p> <p>When you are done, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code> contains two lines:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language=""> FROM ubuntu:15.04

 RUN echo "Hello world" &gt; /tmp/newfile
</pre>  </li> <li> <p>Save and close the file.</p> </li> <li> <p>From a terminal in the same folder as your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code>, run the following command:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language=""> $ docker build -t changed-ubuntu .

</pre>  <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker history</code> output shows the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">94e6b7d2c720</code> image layer at the top. You know that this is the new image layer added because it was created by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo "Hello world" &gt; /tmp/newfile</code> command in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code>. The 4 image layers below it are the exact same image layers that make up the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ubuntu:15.04</code> image.</p> </li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Under the content addressable storage model introduced with Docker 1.10, image history data is no longer stored in a config file with each image layer. It is now stored as a string of text in a single config file that relates to the overall image. This can result in some image layers showing as “missing” in the output of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker history</code> command. This is normal behaviour and can be ignored.</p> <p>You may hear images like these referred to as <em>flat images</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Notice the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">changed-ubuntu</code> image does not have its own copies of every layer. As can be seen in the diagram below, the new image is sharing its four underlying layers with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ubuntu:15.04</code> image.</p> <p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/saving-space.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker history</code> command also shows the size of each image layer. As you can see, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">94e6b7d2c720</code> layer is only consuming 12 Bytes of disk space. This means that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">changed-ubuntu</code> image we just created is only consuming an additional 12 Bytes of disk space on the Docker host - all layers below the <code class="highlighter-rouge">94e6b7d2c720</code> layer already exist on the Docker host and are shared by other images.</p> <p>This sharing of image layers is what makes Docker images and containers so space efficient.</p> <h3 id="copying-makes-containers-efficient">Copying makes containers efficient</h3> <p>You learned earlier that a container is a Docker image with a thin writable, container layer added. The diagram below shows the layers of a container based on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ubuntu:15.04</code> image:</p> <p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/container-layers-cas.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>All writes made to a container are stored in the thin writable container layer. The other layers are read-only (RO) image layers and can’t be changed. This means that multiple containers can safely share a single underlying image. The diagram below shows multiple containers sharing a single copy of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ubuntu:15.04</code> image. Each container has its own thin RW layer, but they all share a single instance of the ubuntu:15.04 image:</p> <p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/sharing-layers.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>When an existing file in a container is modified, Docker uses the storage driver to perform a copy-on-write operation. The specifics of operation depends on the storage driver. For the AUFS and OverlayFS storage drivers, the copy-on-write operation is pretty much as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Search through the image layers for the file to update. The process starts at the top, newest layer and works down to the base layer one layer at a time.</li> <li>Perform a “copy-up” operation on the first copy of the file that is found. A “copy up” copies the file up to the container’s own thin writable layer.</li> <li>Modify the <em>copy of the file</em> in container’s thin writable layer.</li> </ul> <p>Btrfs, ZFS, and other drivers handle the copy-on-write differently. You can read more about the methods of these drivers later in their detailed descriptions.</p> <p>Containers that write a lot of data will consume more space than containers that do not. This is because most write operations consume new space in the container’s thin writable top layer. If your container needs to write a lot of data, you should consider using a data volume.</p> <p>A copy-up operation can incur a noticeable performance overhead. This overhead is different depending on which storage driver is in use. However, large files, lots of layers, and deep directory trees can make the impact more noticeable. Fortunately, the operation only occurs the first time any particular file is modified. Subsequent modifications to the same file do not cause a copy-up operation and can operate directly on the file’s existing copy already present in the container layer.</p> <p>Let’s see what happens if we spin up 5 containers based on our <code class="highlighter-rouge">changed-ubuntu</code> image we built earlier:</p> <ol> <li> <p>From a terminal on your Docker host, run the following <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker run</code> command 5 times.</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language=""> $ docker run -dit changed-ubuntu bash

</pre>  </li> </ol> <p>Docker’s copy-on-write strategy not only reduces the amount of space consumed by containers, it also reduces the time required to start a container. At start time, Docker only has to create the thin writable layer for each container. The diagram below shows these 5 containers sharing a single read-only (RO) copy of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">changed-ubuntu</code> image.</p> <p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/shared-uuid.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>If Docker had to make an entire copy of the underlying image stack each time it started a new container, container start times and disk space used would be significantly increased.</p> <h2 id="data-volumes-and-the-storage-driver">Data volumes and the storage driver</h2> <p>When a container is deleted, any data written to the container that is not stored in a <em>data volume</em> is deleted along with the container.</p> <p>A data volume is a directory or file in the Docker host’s filesystem that is mounted directly into a container. Data volumes are not controlled by the storage driver. Reads and writes to data volumes bypass the storage driver and operate at native host speeds. You can mount any number of data volumes into a container. Multiple containers can also share one or more data volumes.</p> <p>The diagram below shows a single Docker host running two containers. Each container exists inside of its own address space within the Docker host’s local storage area (<code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/lib/docker/...</code>). There is also a single shared data volume located at <code class="highlighter-rouge">/data</code> on the Docker host. This is mounted directly into both containers.</p> <p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/shared-volume.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Data volumes reside outside of the local storage area on the Docker host, further reinforcing their independence from the storage driver’s control. When a container is deleted, any data stored in data volumes persists on the Docker host.</p> <p>For detailed information about data volumes <a href="../../../tutorials/dockervolumes/">Managing data in containers</a>.</p> <h2 id="related-information">Related information</h2> <ul> <li><a href="../selectadriver/">Select a storage driver</a></li> <li><a href="../aufs-driver/">AUFS storage driver in practice</a></li> <li><a href="../btrfs-driver/">Btrfs storage driver in practice</a></li> <li><a href="../device-mapper-driver/">Device Mapper storage driver in practice</a></li> </ul>
