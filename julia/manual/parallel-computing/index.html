<h1 id="man-parallel-computing">Parallel Computing</h1> <p>Most modern computers possess more than one CPU, and several computers can be combined together in a cluster. Harnessing the power of these multiple CPUs allows many computations to be completed more quickly. There are two major factors that influence performance: the speed of the CPUs themselves, and the speed of their access to memory. In a cluster, it’s fairly obvious that a given CPU will have fastest access to the RAM within the same computer (node). Perhaps more surprisingly, similar issues are relevant on a typical multicore laptop, due to differences in the speed of main memory and the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf" target="_blank">cache</a>. Consequently, a good multiprocessing environment should allow control over the “ownership” of a chunk of memory by a particular CPU. Julia provides a multiprocessing environment based on message passing to allow programs to run on multiple processes in separate memory domains at once.</p> <p>Julia’s implementation of message passing is different from other environments such as MPI <a class="footnote-reference" href="#mpi2rma" id="id1">[1]</a>. Communication in Julia is generally “one-sided”, meaning that the programmer needs to explicitly manage only one process in a two-process operation. Furthermore, these operations typically do not look like “message send” and “message receive” but rather resemble higher-level operations like calls to user functions.</p> <p>Parallel programming in Julia is built on two primitives: <em>remote references</em> and <em>remote calls</em>. A remote reference is an object that can be used from any process to refer to an object stored on a particular process. A remote call is a request by one process to call a certain function on certain arguments on another (possibly the same) process.</p> <p>Remote references come in two flavors - <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.Future" title="Base.Future"><code>Future</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.RemoteChannel" title="Base.RemoteChannel"><code>RemoteChannel</code></a>.</p> <p>A remote call returns a <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.Future" title="Base.Future"><code>Future</code></a> to its result. Remote calls return immediately; the process that made the call proceeds to its next operation while the remote call happens somewhere else. You can wait for a remote call to finish by calling <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.wait" title="Base.wait"><code>wait()</code></a> on the returned <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.Future" title="Base.Future"><code>Future</code></a>, and you can obtain the full value of the result using <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.fetch" title="Base.fetch"><code>fetch()</code></a>.</p> <p>On the other hand <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.RemoteChannel" title="Base.RemoteChannel"><code>RemoteChannel</code></a> s are rewritable. For example, multiple processes can co-ordinate their processing by referencing the same remote <code>Channel</code>.</p> <p>Let’s try this out. Starting with <code>julia -p n</code> provides <code>n</code> worker processes on the local machine. Generally it makes sense for <code>n</code> to equal the number of CPU cores on the machine.</p> <pre data-language="julia">$ ./julia -p 2

julia&gt; r = remotecall(rand, 2, 2, 2)
Future(2,1,3,Nullable{Any}())

julia&gt; s = @spawnat 2 1 .+ fetch(r)
Future(2,1,6,Nullable{Any}())

julia&gt; fetch(s)
2×2 Array{Float64,2}:
 1.60401  1.50111
 1.17457  1.15741
</pre> <p>The first argument to <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.remotecall" title="Base.remotecall"><code>remotecall()</code></a> is the function to call. Most parallel programming in Julia does not reference specific processes or the number of processes available, but <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.remotecall" title="Base.remotecall"><code>remotecall()</code></a> is considered a low-level interface providing finer control. The second argument to <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.remotecall" title="Base.remotecall"><code>remotecall()</code></a> is the index of the process that will do the work, and the remaining arguments will be passed to the function being called.</p> <p>As you can see, in the first line we asked process 2 to construct a 2-by-2 random matrix, and in the second line we asked it to add 1 to it. The result of both calculations is available in the two futures, <code>r</code> and <code>s</code>. The <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@spawnat" title="Base.@spawnat"><code>@spawnat</code></a> macro evaluates the expression in the second argument on the process specified by the first argument.</p> <p>Occasionally you might want a remotely-computed value immediately. This typically happens when you read from a remote object to obtain data needed by the next local operation. The function <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.remotecall_fetch" title="Base.remotecall_fetch"><code>remotecall_fetch()</code></a> exists for this purpose. It is equivalent to <code>fetch(remotecall(...))</code> but is more efficient.</p> <pre data-language="julia">julia&gt; remotecall_fetch(getindex, 2, r, 1, 1)
0.10824216411304866
</pre> <p>Remember that <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/collections/#Base.getindex" title="Base.getindex"><code>getindex(r,1,1)</code></a> is <a class="reference internal" href="../arrays/#man-array-indexing"><span>equivalent</span></a> to <code>r[1,1]</code>, so this call fetches the first element of the future <code>r</code>.</p> <p>The syntax of <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.remotecall" title="Base.remotecall"><code>remotecall()</code></a> is not especially convenient. The macro <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@spawn" title="Base.@spawn"><code>@spawn</code></a> makes things easier. It operates on an expression rather than a function, and picks where to do the operation for you:</p> <pre data-language="julia">julia&gt; r = @spawn rand(2,2)
Future(2,1,4,Nullable{Any}())

julia&gt; s = @spawn 1 .+ fetch(r)
Future(3,1,5,Nullable{Any}())

1.12376292706355074 1.18750497916607167
</pre> <p>Note that we used <code>1 .+ fetch(r)</code> instead of <code>1 .+ r</code>. This is because we do not know where the code will run, so in general a <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.fetch" title="Base.fetch"><code>fetch()</code></a> might be required to move <code>r</code> to the process doing the addition. In this case, <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@spawn" title="Base.@spawn"><code>@spawn</code></a> is smart enough to perform the computation on the process that owns <code>r</code>, so the <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.fetch" title="Base.fetch"><code>fetch()</code></a> will be a no-op (no work is done).</p> <p>(It is worth noting that <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@spawn" title="Base.@spawn"><code>@spawn</code></a> is not built-in but defined in Julia as a <a class="reference internal" href="../metaprogramming/#man-macros"><span>macro</span></a>. It is possible to define your own such constructs.)</p> <p>An important thing to remember is that, once fetched, a <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.Future" title="Base.Future"><code>Future</code></a> will cache its value locally. Further <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.fetch" title="Base.fetch"><code>fetch()</code></a> calls do not entail a network hop. Once all referencing <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.Future" title="Base.Future"><code>Future</code></a>s have fetched, the remote stored value is deleted.</p>  <h2 id="man-parallel-computing-code-availability">Code Availability and Loading Packages</h2> <p id="code-availability-and-loading-packages">Your code must be available on any process that runs it. For example, type the following into the Julia prompt:</p> <pre data-language="julia">julia&gt; function rand2(dims...)
         return 2*rand(dims...)
       end

julia&gt; rand2(2,2)

julia&gt; fetch(@spawn rand2(2,2))
ERROR: On worker 2:
function rand2 not defined on process 2
</pre> <p>Process 1 knew about the function <code>rand2</code>, but process 2 did not.</p> <p>Most commonly you’ll be loading code from files or packages, and you have a considerable amount of flexibility in controlling which processes load code. Consider a file, <code>"DummyModule.jl"</code>, containing the following code:</p> <pre data-language="julia">module DummyModule

export MyType, f

type MyType
    a::Int
end

f(x) = x^2+1

println("loaded")

end
</pre> <p>Starting Julia with <code>julia -p 2</code>, you can use this to verify the following:</p> <ul> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/base/#Base.include" title="Base.include"><code>include("DummyModule.jl")</code></a> loads the file on just a single process (whichever one executes the statement). </li> <li>
<code>using DummyModule</code> causes the module to be loaded on all processes; however, the module is brought into scope only on the one executing the statement. </li> <li>
<p class="first">As long as <code>DummyModule</code> is loaded on process 2, commands like</p> <pre data-language="julia">rr = RemoteChannel(2)
put!(rr, MyType(7))
</pre> <p>allow you to store an object of type <code>MyType</code> on process 2 even if <code>DummyModule</code> is not in scope on process 2.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can force a command to run on all processes using the <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@everywhere" title="Base.@everywhere"><code>@everywhere</code></a> macro. For example, <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@everywhere" title="Base.@everywhere"><code>@everywhere</code></a> can also be used to directly define a function on all processes:</p> <pre data-language="julia">julia&gt; @everywhere id = myid()

julia&gt; remotecall_fetch(()-&gt;id, 2)
2
</pre> <p>A file can also be preloaded on multiple processes at startup, and a driver script can be used to drive the computation:</p> <pre data-language="julia">julia -p &lt;n&gt; -L file1.jl -L file2.jl driver.jl
</pre> <p>Each process has an associated identifier. The process providing the interactive Julia prompt always has an <code>id</code> equal to 1, as would the Julia process running the driver script in the example above. The processes used by default for parallel operations are referred to as “workers”. When there is only one process, process 1 is considered a worker. Otherwise, workers are considered to be all processes other than process 1.</p> <p>The base Julia installation has in-built support for two types of clusters:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>A local cluster specified with the <code>-p</code> option as shown above.</li> <li>A cluster spanning machines using the <code>--machinefile</code> option. This uses a passwordless <code>ssh</code> login to start Julia worker processes (from the same path as the current host) on the specified machines.</li> </ul> <p>Functions <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.addprocs" title="Base.addprocs"><code>addprocs()</code></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.rmprocs" title="Base.rmprocs"><code>rmprocs()</code></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.workers" title="Base.workers"><code>workers()</code></a>, and others are available as a programmatic means of adding, removing and querying the processes in a cluster.</p> <p>Note that workers do not run a <code>.juliarc.jl</code> startup script, nor do they synchronize their global state (such as global variables, new method definitions, and loaded modules) with any of the other running processes.</p> <p>Other types of clusters can be supported by writing your own custom <code>ClusterManager</code>, as described below in the <a class="reference internal" href="#man-clustermanagers"><span>ClusterManagers</span></a> section.</p>   <h2 id="data-movement">Data Movement</h2> <p>Sending messages and moving data constitute most of the overhead in a parallel program. Reducing the number of messages and the amount of data sent is critical to achieving performance and scalability. To this end, it is important to understand the data movement performed by Julia’s various parallel programming constructs.</p> <p><a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.fetch" title="Base.fetch"><code>fetch()</code></a> can be considered an explicit data movement operation, since it directly asks that an object be moved to the local machine. <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@spawn" title="Base.@spawn"><code>@spawn</code></a> (and a few related constructs) also moves data, but this is not as obvious, hence it can be called an implicit data movement operation. Consider these two approaches to constructing and squaring a random matrix:</p> <pre data-language="julia"># method 1
A = rand(1000,1000)
Bref = @spawn A^2
...
fetch(Bref)

# method 2
Bref = @spawn rand(1000,1000)^2
...
fetch(Bref)
</pre> <p>The difference seems trivial, but in fact is quite significant due to the behavior of <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@spawn" title="Base.@spawn"><code>@spawn</code></a>. In the first method, a random matrix is constructed locally, then sent to another process where it is squared. In the second method, a random matrix is both constructed and squared on another process. Therefore the second method sends much less data than the first.</p> <p>In this toy example, the two methods are easy to distinguish and choose from. However, in a real program designing data movement might require more thought and likely some measurement. For example, if the first process needs matrix <code>A</code> then the first method might be better. Or, if computing <code>A</code> is expensive and only the current process has it, then moving it to another process might be unavoidable. Or, if the current process has very little to do between the <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@spawn" title="Base.@spawn"><code>@spawn</code></a> and <code>fetch(Bref)</code>, it might be better to eliminate the parallelism altogether. Or imagine <code>rand(1000,1000)</code> is replaced with a more expensive operation. Then it might make sense to add another <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@spawn" title="Base.@spawn"><code>@spawn</code></a> statement just for this step.</p>   <h2 id="parallel-map-and-loops">Parallel Map and Loops</h2> <p>Fortunately, many useful parallel computations do not require data movement. A common example is a Monte Carlo simulation, where multiple processes can handle independent simulation trials simultaneously. We can use <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@spawn" title="Base.@spawn"><code>@spawn</code></a> to flip coins on two processes. First, write the following function in <code>count_heads.jl</code>:</p> <pre data-language="julia">function count_heads(n)
    c::Int = 0
    for i=1:n
        c += rand(Bool)
    end
    c
end
</pre> <p>The function <code>count_heads</code> simply adds together <code>n</code> random bits. Here is how we can perform some trials on two machines, and add together the results:</p> <pre data-language="julia">@everywhere include("count_heads.jl")

a = @spawn count_heads(100000000)
b = @spawn count_heads(100000000)
fetch(a)+fetch(b)
</pre> <p>This example demonstrates a powerful and often-used parallel programming pattern. Many iterations run independently over several processes, and then their results are combined using some function. The combination process is called a <em>reduction</em>, since it is generally tensor-rank-reducing: a vector of numbers is reduced to a single number, or a matrix is reduced to a single row or column, etc. In code, this typically looks like the pattern <code>x = f(x,v[i])</code>, where <code>x</code> is the accumulator, <code>f</code> is the reduction function, and the <code>v[i]</code> are the elements being reduced. It is desirable for <code>f</code> to be associative, so that it does not matter what order the operations are performed in.</p> <p>Notice that our use of this pattern with <code>count_heads</code> can be generalized. We used two explicit <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@spawn" title="Base.@spawn"><code>@spawn</code></a> statements, which limits the parallelism to two processes. To run on any number of processes, we can use a <em>parallel for loop</em>, which can be written in Julia like this:</p> <pre data-language="julia">nheads = @parallel (+) for i=1:200000000
  Int(rand(Bool))
end
</pre> <p>This construct implements the pattern of assigning iterations to multiple processes, and combining them with a specified reduction (in this case <code>(+)</code>). The result of each iteration is taken as the value of the last expression inside the loop. The whole parallel loop expression itself evaluates to the final answer.</p> <p>Note that although parallel for loops look like serial for loops, their behavior is dramatically different. In particular, the iterations do not happen in a specified order, and writes to variables or arrays will not be globally visible since iterations run on different processes. Any variables used inside the parallel loop will be copied and broadcast to each process.</p> <p>For example, the following code will not work as intended:</p> <pre data-language="julia">a = zeros(100000)
@parallel for i=1:100000
  a[i] = i
end
</pre> <p>However, this code will not initialize all of <code>a</code>, since each process will have a separate copy of it. Parallel for loops like these must be avoided. Fortunately, <a class="reference external" href="#shared-arrays">Shared Arrays</a> can be used to get around this limitation:</p> <pre data-language="julia">a = SharedArray(Float64,10)
@parallel for i=1:10
  a[i] = i
end
</pre> <p>Using “outside” variables in parallel loops is perfectly reasonable if the variables are read-only:</p> <pre data-language="julia">a = randn(1000)
@parallel (+) for i=1:100000
  f(a[rand(1:end)])
end
</pre> <p>Here each iteration applies <code>f</code> to a randomly-chosen sample from a vector <code>a</code> shared by all processes.</p> <p>As you could see, the reduction operator can be omitted if it is not needed. In that case, the loop executes asynchronously, i.e. it spawns independent tasks on all available workers and returns an array of <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.Future" title="Base.Future"><code>Future</code></a> immediately without waiting for completion. The caller can wait for the <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.Future" title="Base.Future"><code>Future</code></a> completions at a later point by calling <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.fetch" title="Base.fetch"><code>fetch()</code></a> on them, or wait for completion at the end of the loop by prefixing it with <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@sync" title="Base.@sync"><code>@sync</code></a>, like <code>@sync @parallel for</code>.</p> <p>In some cases no reduction operator is needed, and we merely wish to apply a function to all integers in some range (or, more generally, to all elements in some collection). This is another useful operation called <em>parallel map</em>, implemented in Julia as the <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.pmap" title="Base.pmap"><code>pmap()</code></a> function. For example, we could compute the singular values of several large random matrices in parallel as follows:</p> <pre data-language="julia">M = Matrix{Float64}[rand(1000,1000) for i=1:10]
pmap(svd, M)
</pre> <p>Julia’s <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.pmap" title="Base.pmap"><code>pmap()</code></a> is designed for the case where each function call does a large amount of work. In contrast, <code>@parallel for</code> can handle situations where each iteration is tiny, perhaps merely summing two numbers. Only worker processes are used by both <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.pmap" title="Base.pmap"><code>pmap()</code></a> and <code>@parallel for</code> for the parallel computation. In case of <code>@parallel for</code>, the final reduction is done on the calling process.</p>   <h2 id="synchronization-with-remote-references">Synchronization With Remote References</h2>   <h2 id="scheduling">Scheduling</h2> <p>Julia’s parallel programming platform uses <a class="reference internal" href="../control-flow/#man-tasks"><span>Tasks (aka Coroutines)</span></a> to switch among multiple computations. Whenever code performs a communication operation like <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.fetch" title="Base.fetch"><code>fetch()</code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.wait" title="Base.wait"><code>wait()</code></a>, the current task is suspended and a scheduler picks another task to run. A task is restarted when the event it is waiting for completes.</p> <p>For many problems, it is not necessary to think about tasks directly. However, they can be used to wait for multiple events at the same time, which provides for <em>dynamic scheduling</em>. In dynamic scheduling, a program decides what to compute or where to compute it based on when other jobs finish. This is needed for unpredictable or unbalanced workloads, where we want to assign more work to processes only when they finish their current tasks.</p> <p>As an example, consider computing the singular values of matrices of different sizes:</p> <pre data-language="julia">M = Matrix{Float64}[rand(800,800), rand(600,600), rand(800,800), rand(600,600)]
pmap(svd, M)
</pre> <p>If one process handles both 800×800 matrices and another handles both 600×600 matrices, we will not get as much scalability as we could. The solution is to make a local task to “feed” work to each process when it completes its current task. For example, consider a simple <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.pmap" title="Base.pmap"><code>pmap()</code></a> implementation:</p> <pre data-language="julia">function pmap(f, lst)
    np = nprocs()  # determine the number of processes available
    n = length(lst)
    results = Vector{Any}(n)
    i = 1
    # function to produce the next work item from the queue.
    # in this case it's just an index.
    nextidx() = (idx=i; i+=1; idx)
    @sync begin
        for p=1:np
            if p != myid() || np == 1
                @async begin
                    while true
                        idx = nextidx()
                        if idx &gt; n
                            break
                        end
                        results[idx] = remotecall_fetch(f, p, lst[idx])
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
    results
end
</pre> <p><a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@async" title="Base.@async"><code>@async</code></a> is similar to <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@spawn" title="Base.@spawn"><code>@spawn</code></a>, but only runs tasks on the local process. We use it to create a “feeder” task for each process. Each task picks the next index that needs to be computed, then waits for its process to finish, then repeats until we run out of indexes. Note that the feeder tasks do not begin to execute until the main task reaches the end of the <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@sync" title="Base.@sync"><code>@sync</code></a> block, at which point it surrenders control and waits for all the local tasks to complete before returning from the function. The feeder tasks are able to share state via <code>nextidx()</code> because they all run on the same process. No locking is required, since the threads are scheduled cooperatively and not preemptively. This means context switches only occur at well-defined points: in this case, when <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.remotecall_fetch" title="Base.remotecall_fetch"><code>remotecall_fetch()</code></a> is called.</p>   <h2 id="channels">Channels</h2> <p>Channels provide for a fast means of inter-task communication.

While there are some similarities to a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JuliaParallel/DistributedArrays.jl" target="_blank">DArray</a>, the behavior of a <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.SharedArray" title="Base.SharedArray"><code>SharedArray</code></a> is quite different. In a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JuliaParallel/DistributedArrays.jl" target="_blank">DArray</a>, each process has local access to just a chunk of the data, and no two processes share the same chunk; in contrast, in a <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.SharedArray" title="Base.SharedArray"><code>SharedArray</code></a> each “participating” process has access to the entire array. A <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.SharedArray" title="Base.SharedArray"><code>SharedArray</code></a> is a good choice when you want to have a large amount of data jointly accessible to two or more processes on the same machine.</p> <p><a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.SharedArray" title="Base.SharedArray"><code>SharedArray</code></a> indexing (assignment and accessing values) works just as with regular arrays, and is efficient because the underlying memory is available to the local process. Therefore, most algorithms work naturally on <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.SharedArray" title="Base.SharedArray"><code>SharedArray</code></a>s, albeit in single-process mode. In cases where an algorithm insists on an <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/arrays/#Base.Array" title="Base.Array"><code>Array</code></a> input, the underlying array can be retrieved from a <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.SharedArray" title="Base.SharedArray"><code>SharedArray</code></a> by calling <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.sdata" title="Base.sdata"><code>sdata()</code></a>. For other <code>AbstractArray</code> types, <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.sdata" title="Base.sdata"><code>sdata()</code></a> just returns the object itself, so it’s safe to use <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.sdata" title="Base.sdata"><code>sdata()</code></a> on any <code>Array</code>-type object.</p> <p>The constructor for a shared array is of the form:</p> <pre data-language="julia">SharedArray(T::Type, dims::NTuple; init=false, pids=Int[])
</pre> <p>which creates a shared array of a bits type <code>T</code> and size <code>dims</code> across the processes specified by <code>pids</code>. Unlike distributed arrays, a shared array is accessible only from those participating workers specified by the <code>pids</code> named argument (and the creating process too, if it is on the same host).</p> <p>If an <code>init</code> function, of signature <code>initfn(S::SharedArray)</code>, is specified, it is called on all the participating workers. You can specify that each worker runs the <code>init</code> function on a distinct portion of the array, thereby parallelizing initialization.</p> <p>Here’s a brief example:</p> <pre data-language="julia">julia&gt; addprocs(3)
3-element Array{Int64,1}:
 2
 3
 4

julia&gt; S = SharedArray(Int, (3,4), init = S -&gt; S[Base.localindexes(S)] = myid())
3×4 SharedArray{Int64,2}:

</pre> <p><a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.localindexes" title="Base.localindexes"><code>Base.localindexes()</code></a> provides disjoint one-dimensional ranges of indexes, and is sometimes convenient for splitting up tasks among processes. You can, of course, divide the work any way you wish:</p> <pre data-language="julia">julia&gt; S = SharedArray(Int, (3,4), init = S -&gt; S[indexpids(S):length(procs(S)):length(S)] = myid())

 3  3  3  3
 4  4  4  4
</pre> <p>Since all processes have access to the underlying data, you do have to be careful not to set up conflicts. For example:</p> <pre data-language="julia">@sync begin
    for p in procs(S)
        @async begin
            remotecall_wait(fill!, p, S, p)
        end
    end
end
</pre> <p>would result in undefined behavior. Because each process fills the <em>entire</em> array with its own <code>pid</code>, whichever process is the last to execute (for any particular element of <code>S</code>) will have its <code>pid</code> retained.</p> <p>As a more extended and complex example, consider running the following “kernel” in parallel:</p> <pre data-language="julia">q[i,j,t+1] = q[i,j,t] + u[i,j,t]
</pre> <p>In this case, if we try to split up the work using a one-dimensional index, we are likely to run into trouble: if <code>q[i,j,t]</code> is near the end of the block assigned to one worker and <code>q[i,j,t+1]</code> is near the beginning of the block assigned to another, it’s very likely that <code>q[i,j,t]</code> will not be ready at the time it’s needed for computing <code>q[i,j,t+1]</code>. In such cases, one is better off chunking the array manually. Let’s split along the second dimension:</p> <pre data-language="julia"># This function retuns the (irange,jrange) indexes assigned to this worker
@everywhere function myrange(q::SharedArray)
    idx = indexpids(q)
    if idx == 0

        return 1:0, 1:0
    end
    nchunks = length(procs(q))
    splits = [round(Int, s) for s in linspace(0,size(q,2),nchunks+1)]
    1:size(q,1), splits[idx]+1:splits[idx+1]
end

# Here's the kernel
@everywhere function advection_chunk!(q, u, irange, jrange, trange)
    @show (irange, jrange, trange)  # display so we can see what's happening
    for t in trange, j in jrange, i in irange
        q[i,j,t+1] = q[i,j,t] +  u[i,j,t]

    q
end

# Here's a convenience wrapper for a SharedArray implementation
@everywhere advection_shared_chunk!(q, u) = advection_chunk!(q, u, myrange(q)..., 1:size(q,3)-1)
</pre> <p>Now let’s compare three different versions, one that runs in a single process:</p> <pre data-language="julia">advection_serial!(q, u) = advection_chunk!(q, u, 1:size(q,1), 1:size(q,2), 1:size(q,3)-1)
</pre> <p>one that uses <code>@parallel</code>:</p> <pre data-language="julia">function advection_parallel!(q, u)
    for t = 1:size(q,3)-1
        @sync @parallel for j = 1:size(q,2)
            for i = 1:size(q,1)
                q[i,j,t+1]= q[i,j,t] + u[i,j,t]
            end
        end
    end
    q
end
</pre> <p>and one that delegates in chunks:</p> <pre data-language="julia">function advection_shared!(q, u)
    @sync begin

Custom cluster managers can use an in-memory <code>BufferStream</code> as the plumbing to proxy data between the custom, possibly non-<code>IO</code> transport and Julia’s in-built parallel infrastructure.</p> <p>A <code>BufferStream</code> is an in-memory <code>IOBuffer</code> which behaves like an <code>IO</code> - it is a stream which can be handled asynchronously.</p> <p>Folder <code>examples/clustermanager/0mq</code> contains an example of using ZeroMQ to connect Julia workers in a star topology with a 0MQ broker in the middle. Note: The Julia processes are still all <em>logically</em> connected to each other - any worker can message any other worker directly without any awareness of 0MQ being used as the transport layer.</p> <p>When using custom transports:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Julia workers must NOT be started with <code>--worker</code>. Starting with <code>--worker</code> will result in the newly launched workers defaulting to the TCP/IP socket transport implementation</li> <li>For every incoming logical connection with a worker, <code>Base.process_messages(rd::IO, wr::IO)()</code> must be called. This launches a new task that handles reading and writing of messages from/to the worker represented by the <code>IO</code> objects</li> <li>
<code>init_worker(cookie, manager::FooManager)</code> MUST be called as part of worker process initialization</li> <li>Field <code>connect_at::Any</code> in <code>WorkerConfig</code> can be set by the cluster manager when <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.launch" title="Base.launch"><code>launch()</code></a> is called. The value of this field is passed in in all <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.connect" title="Base.connect"><code>connect()</code></a> callbacks. Typically, it carries information on <em>how to connect</em> to a worker. For example, the TCP/IP socket transport uses this field to specify the <code>(host, port)</code> tuple at which to connect to a worker</li> </ul> <p><code>kill(manager, pid, config)</code> is called to remove a worker from the cluster. On the master process, the corresponding <code>IO</code> objects must be closed by the implementation to ensure proper cleanup. The default implementation simply executes an <code>exit()</code> call on the specified remote worker.</p> <p><code>examples/clustermanager/simple</code> is an example that shows a simple implementation using UNIX domain sockets for cluster setup.</p>   <h2 id="network-requirements-for-localmanager-and-sshmanager">Network requirements for LocalManager and SSHManager</h2> <p>Julia clusters are designed to be executed on already secured environments on infrastructure such as local laptops, departmental clusters, or even on the cloud. This section covers network security requirements for the inbuilt <code>LocalManager</code> and <code>SSHManager</code>:</p> <ul> <li>The master process does not listen on any port. It only connects out to the workers. </li> <li>Each worker binds to only one of the local interfaces and listens on the first free port starting from <code>9009</code>. </li> <li>
<code>LocalManager</code>, i.e. <code>addprocs(N)</code>, by default binds only to the loopback interface. This means that workers consequently started on remote hosts, or anyone with malicious intentions is unable to connect to the cluster. A <code>addprocs(4)</code> followed by a <code>addprocs(["remote_host"])</code> will fail. Some users may need to create a cluster comprised of their local system and a few remote systems. This can be done by explicitly requesting <code>LocalManager</code> to bind to an external network interface via the <code>restrict</code> keyword argument. For example, <code>addprocs(4; restrict=false)</code>. </li> <li>
<code>SSHManager</code>, i.e. <code>addprocs(list_of_remote_hosts)</code> launches workers on remote hosts via SSH. It is to be noted that by default SSH is only used to launch Julia workers. Subsequent master-worker and worker-worker connections use plain, unencrypted TCP/IP sockets. The remote hosts must have passwordless login enabled. Additional SSH flags or credentials may be specified via keyword argument <code>sshflags</code>. </li> <li>
<p class="first"><code>addprocs(list_of_remote_hosts; tunnel=true, sshflags=&lt;ssh keys and other flags&gt;)</code> is useful when we wish to use SSH connections for master-worker too. A typical scenario for this is a local laptop running the Julia REPL (i.e., the master) with the rest of the cluster on the cloud, say on Amazon EC2. In this case only port 22 needs to be opened at the remote cluster coupled with SSH client authenticated via public key infrastructure (PKI). Authentication credentials can be supplied via <code>sshflags</code>, for example <code>sshflags=`-e &lt;keyfile&gt;`</code>.</p> <p>Note that worker-worker connections are still plain TCP and the local security policy on the remote cluster must allow for free connections between worker nodes, at least for ports 9009 and above.</p> <p>Securing and encrypting all worker-worker traffic (via SSH), or encrypting individual messages can be done via a custom ClusterManager.</p> </li> </ul>   <h2 id="cluster-cookie">Cluster cookie</h2> <p>All processes in a cluster share the same cookie which, by default, is a randomly generated string on the master process:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.Base.cluster_cookie" title="Base.Base.cluster_cookie"><code>Base.cluster_cookie()</code></a> returns the cookie, while <code>Base.cluster_cookie(cookie)()</code> sets it and returns the new cookie.</li> <li>All connections are authenticated on both sides to ensure that only workers started by the master are allowed to connect to each other.</li> <li>The cookie must be passed to the workers at startup via argument <code>--worker &lt;cookie&gt;</code>. Custom ClusterManagers can retrieve the cookie on the master by calling <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.Base.cluster_cookie" title="Base.Base.cluster_cookie"><code>Base.cluster_cookie()</code></a>. Cluster managers not using the default TCP/IP transport (and hence not specifying <code>--worker</code>) must call <code>init_worker(cookie, manager)</code> with the same cookie as on the master.</li> </ul> <p>Note that environments requiring higher levels of security can implement this via a custom <code>ClusterManager</code>. For example, cookies can be pre-shared and hence not specified as a startup argument.</p>   <h2 id="specifying-network-topology-experimental">Specifying network topology (Experimental)</h2> <p>Keyword argument <code>topology</code> to <code>addprocs</code> is used to specify how the workers must be connected to each other:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>:all_to_all</code> : is the default, where all workers are connected to each other.</li> <li>
<code>:master_slave</code> : only the driver process, i.e. <code>pid</code> 1 has connections to the workers.</li> <li>
<code>:custom</code> : the <code>launch</code> method of the cluster manager specifies the connection topology. Fields <code>ident</code> and <code>connect_idents</code> in <code>WorkerConfig</code> are used to specify the same. <code>connect_idents</code> is a list of <code>ClusterManager</code> provided identifiers to workers that worker with identified by <code>ident</code> must connect to.</li> </ul> <p>Currently, sending a message between unconnected workers results in an error. This behaviour, as with the functionality and interface, should be considered experimental in nature and may change in future releases.</p>   <h2 id="multi-threading-experimental">Multi-threading (Experimental)</h2> <p>In addition to tasks, remote calls, and remote references, Julia from <code>v0.5</code> forwards will natively support multi-threading. Note that this section is experimental and the interfaces may change in the future.</p>  <h3 id="setup">Setup</h3> <p>By default, Julia starts up with a single thread of execution. This can be verified by using the command <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.Threads.nthreads" title="Base.Threads.nthreads"><code>Threads.nthreads()</code></a>:</p> <pre data-language="julia">julia&gt; Threads.nthreads()
1
</pre> <p>The number of threads Julia starts up with is controlled by an environment variable called <code>JULIA_NUM_THREADS</code>. Now, let’s start up Julia with 4 threads:</p> <pre data-language="julia">export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4
</pre> <p>(The above command works on bourne shells on Linux and OSX. Note that if you’re using a C shell on these platforms, you should use the keyword <code>set</code> instead of <code>export</code>. If you’re on Windows, start up the command line in the location of <code>julia.exe</code> and use <code>set</code> instead of <code>export</code>.)</p> <p>Let’s verify there are 4 threads at our disposal.</p> <pre data-language="julia">julia&gt; Threads.nthreads()
4
</pre> <p>But we are currently on the master thread. To check, we use the command <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.Threads.threadid" title="Base.Threads.threadid"><code>Threads.threadid()</code></a></p> <pre data-language="julia">julia&gt; Threads.threadid()
1
</pre>   <h3 id="the-threads-macro">The <code>@threads</code> Macro</h3> <p>Let’s work a simple example using our native threads. Let us create an array of zeros:</p> <pre data-language="julia">julia&gt; a = zeros(10)
10-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.0
 0.0
 0.0
 0.0
 0.0
 0.0
 0.0
 0.0
 0.0
 0.0
</pre> <p>Let us operate on this array simultaneously using 4 threads. We’ll have each thread write its thread ID into each location.</p> <p>Julia supports parallel loops using the <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.Threads.@threads" title="Base.Threads.@threads"><code>Threads.@threads</code></a> macro. This macro is affixed in front of a <code>for</code> loop to indicate to Julia that the loop is a multi-threaded region.</p> <pre data-language="julia">Threads.@threads for i = 1:10
    a[i] = Threads.threadid()
end
</pre> <p>The iteration space is split amongst the threads, after which each thread writes its thread ID to its assigned locations.:</p> <pre data-language="julia">julia&gt; a

</pre> <p>Note that <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.Threads.@threads" title="Base.Threads.@threads"><code>Threads.@threads</code></a> does not have an optional reduction parameter like <a class="reference internal" href="../../stdlib/parallel/#Base.@parallel" title="Base.@parallel"><code>@parallel</code></a>.</p>    <h2 id="threadcall-experimental">@threadcall (Experimental)</h2> <p>All I/O tasks, timers, REPL commands, etc are multiplexed onto a single OS thread via an event loop. A patched version of libuv (<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/" target="_blank">http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/</a>) provides this functionality. Yield points provide for co-operatively scheduling multiple tasks onto the same OS thread. I/O tasks and timers yield implicitly while waiting for the event to occur. Calling <code>yield()</code> explicitly allows for other tasks to be scheduled.</p> <p>Thus, a task executing a <code>ccall</code> effectively prevents the Julia scheduler from executing any other tasks till the call returns. This is true for all calls into external libraries. Exceptions are calls into custom C code that call back into Julia (which may then yield) or C code that calls <code>jl_yield()</code> (C equivalent of <code>yield()</code>).</p> <p>Note that while Julia code runs on a single thread (by default), libraries used by Julia may launch their own internal threads. For example, the BLAS library may start as many threads as there are cores on a machine.</p> <p>The <code>@threadcall</code> macro addresses scenarios where we do not want a <code>ccall</code> to block the main Julia event loop. It schedules a C function for execution in a separate thread. A threadpool with a default size of 4 is used for this. The size of the threadpool is controlled via environment variable <code>UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE</code>. While waiting for a free thread, and during function execution once a thread is available, the requesting task (on the main Julia event loop) yields to other tasks. Note that <code>@threadcall</code> does not return till the execution is complete. From a user point of view, it is therefore a blocking call like other Julia APIs.</p> <p>It is very important that the called function does not call back into Julia.</p> <p><code>@threadcall</code> may be removed/changed in future versions of Julia.</p> <h4 class="rubric">Footnotes</h4> <table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="mpi2rma" rules="none">   <tr>

<td>In this context, MPI refers to the MPI-1 standard.
