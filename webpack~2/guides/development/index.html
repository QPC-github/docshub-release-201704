<h1>Development</h1>
<p>On this page we'll explain how to get started with developing and how to choose one of three tools to develop. It is assumed you already have a webpack configuration file.</p> <blockquote class="warning"> Never use any of these tools in production. Ever. </blockquote>
<h2 class="header" id="adjusting-your-text-editor">Adjusting Your Text Editor</h2> <p>Some text editors have a "safe write" feature and enable this by default. As a result, saving a file will not always result in a recompile.</p> <p>Each editor has a different way of disabling this. For the most common ones:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>Sublime Text 3</strong> - Add <code>"atomic_save": false</code> to your user preferences.</li> <li>
<strong>IntelliJ</strong> - use search in the preferences to find "safe write" and disable it.</li> <li>
<strong>Vim</strong> - add <code>:set backupcopy=yes</code> in your settings.</li> <li>
<strong>WebStorm</strong> - uncheck <code>Use "safe write"</code> in Preferences &gt; Appearance &amp; Behavior &gt; System Settings</li> </ul> <h2 class="header" id="source-maps">Source Maps</h2> <p>When a JavaScript exception occurs, you'll often want to know what file and line is generating this error. Since webpack outputs files into one or more bundles, it can be inconvenient to trace the file.</p> <p><strong>Source maps</strong> intend to fix this problem. There are a lot of <a href="../../configuration/devtool/">different options</a> - each with their own advantages and disadvantages. To get started, we'll use this one:</p> <pre data-language="js">devtool: "cheap-eval-source-map"
</pre> <h2 class="header" id="choosing-a-tool">Choosing a Tool</h2> <p>webpack can be used with <strong>watch mode</strong>. In this mode webpack will watch your files, and recompile when they change. <strong>webpack-dev-server</strong> provides an easy to use development server with fast live reloading. If you already have a development server and want full flexibility, <strong>webpack-dev-middleware</strong> can be used as middleware.</p> <p>webpack-dev-server and webpack-dev-middleware use in-memory compilation, meaning that the bundle will not be saved to disk. This makes compiling faster and results in less mess on your file system.</p> <p>In most cases <strong>you'll want to use webpack-dev-server</strong>, since it's the easiest to get started with and offers much functionality out-of-the-box.</p> <h3 class="header" id="webpack-watch-mode">webpack Watch Mode</h3> <p>webpack's watch mode watches files for changes. If any change is detected, it'll run the compilation again.</p> <p>We also want a nice progress bar while it's compiling. Let's run the command:</p> <pre data-language="bash">webpack --progress --watch
</pre> <p>Make a change in one of your files and hit save. You should see that it's recompiling.</p> <p>Watch mode makes no assumptions about a server, so you will need to provide your own. An easy server to use is <a href="https://github.com/zeit/serve" target="_blank"><code>serve</code></a>. After installing (<code>npm i --save-dev serve</code>), you can run it in the directory where the outputted files are:</p> <pre data-language="bash">`npm bin`/serve
</pre> <p>You may find it more convenient to run <code>serve</code> using npm scripts. You can do so by first creating a <code>start</code> script in <code>package.json</code> as follows:</p> <pre data-language="json">...
"scripts": {
  "start": "serve"
}
...
</pre> <p>You can then start the server by running <code>npm start</code> from within your project directory. After each compilation, you will need to manually refresh your browser to see the changes.</p> <blockquote class="tip"> You may find the <code>--single</code> option useful for serving single page apps. </blockquote>
<h3 class="header" id="watch-mode-with-chrome-devtools-workspaces">Watch Mode with Chrome DevTools Workspaces</h3> <p>If you set up Chrome to <a href="https://medium.com/@rafaelideleon/webpack-your-chrome-devtools-workspaces-cb9cca8d50da" target="_blank">persist changes when saving from the <em>Sources</em> panel</a> so you don't have to refresh the page, you will have to setup webpack to use</p> <pre data-language="javascript">devtool: "inline-source-map"
</pre> <p>to continue editing and saving your changes from Chrome or source files.</p> <p>There are some <em>gotchas</em> about using workspaces with watch:</p> <ul> <li>Large chunks (such as a common chunk that is over 1MB) that are rebuilt could cause the page to blank, which will force you to refresh the browser.</li> <li>Smaller chunks will be faster to build than larger chunks since <code>inline-source-map</code> is slower due to having to base64 encode the original source code.</li> </ul> <h3 class="header" id="webpack-dev-server">webpack-dev-server</h3> <p>webpack-dev-server provides you with a server and live reloading. This is easy to setup.</p> <p>To prepare, make sure you have a <code>index.html</code> file that points to your bundle. Assuming that <code>output.filename</code> is <code>bundle.js</code>:</p> <pre data-language="html">&lt;script src="/bundle.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre> <p>Start with installing <code>webpack-dev-server</code> from npm:</p> <pre data-language="bash">npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
</pre> <p>When it's done installing, you should be able to use <code>webpack-dev-server</code> like this:</p> <pre data-language="bash">webpack-dev-server --open
</pre> <blockquote class="tip"> If your console says it can't find the command, try running <code>node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server</code>. Optimally you would add the command to your <code>package.json</code>, like this: <code>"scripts": { "start": "webpack-dev-server" }</code>. </blockquote>
<p>The command above should automatically open your browser on <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p> <p>Make a change in one of your files and hit save. You should see that the console is recompiling. After that's done, the page should be refreshed. If nothing happens in the console, you may need to fiddle with <a href="../../configuration/dev-server/#devserver-watchoptions-"><code>watchOptions</code></a>.</p> <p>Now you have live reloading working, you can take it even a step further: Hot Module Replacement. This is an interface that makes it possible to swap modules <strong>without a page refresh</strong>. Find out how to <a href="../hmr-react/">configure HMR</a>.</p> <p>By default <strong>inline mode</strong> is used. This mode injects the client - needed for live reloading and showing build errors - in your bundle. With inline mode you will get build errors and warnings in your DevTools console.</p> <p>webpack-dev-server can do many more things such as proxying requests to your backend server. For more configuration options, see the <a href="../../configuration/dev-server/"><strong>devServer documentation</strong></a>.</p> <h3 class="header" id="webpack-dev-middleware">webpack-dev-middleware</h3> <p>webpack-dev-middleware works for connect-based middleware stacks. This can be useful if you already have a Node.js server or if you want to have full control over the server.</p> <p>The middleware will cause webpack to compile files in-memory. When a compilation is running, it will delay the request to a file until the compilation is done.</p> <blockquote class="warning"> This is intended for advanced users. webpack-dev-server is much easier to use. </blockquote>
<p>Start with installing the dependencies from npm:</p> <pre data-language="bash">npm install express webpack-dev-middleware --save-dev
</pre> <p>After installing, you can use the middleware like this:</p> <pre data-language="js">var express = require("express");
var webpackDevMiddleware = require("webpack-dev-middleware");
var webpack = require("webpack");
var webpackConfig = require("./webpack.config");

var app = express();
var compiler = webpack(webpackConfig);

app.use(webpackDevMiddleware(compiler, {
  publicPath: "/" // Same as `output.publicPath` in most cases.
}));

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("Listening on port 3000!");
});
</pre> <p>Depending on what you've used in <code>output.publicPath</code> and <code>output.filename</code>, your bundle should now be available on <code>http://localhost:3000/bundle.js</code>.</p> <p>By default, <strong>watch mode</strong> is used. It's also possible to use <strong>lazy mode</strong>, which will only recompile on a request to the entry point.</p> <p>To compile only on a request to the entry <code>bundle.js</code>:</p> <pre data-language="js">app.use(webpackDevMiddleware(compiler, {
  lazy: true,
  filename: "bundle.js" // Same as `output.filename` in most cases.
}));
</pre> <p>There are many more options you can use. For all configuration options, see the <a href="../../configuration/dev-server/"><strong>devServer documentation</strong></a>.</p> <h2 class="header" id="references">References</h2> <ul> <li><a href="http://survivejs.com/webpack/developing-with-webpack/automatic-browser-refresh/" target="_blank">SurviveJS - Automatic Browser Refresh</a></li> <li><a href="https://medium.com/@rafaelideleon/webpack-your-chrome-devtools-workspaces-cb9cca8d50da" target="_blank">webpack your Chrome DevTools Workspaces</a></li> </ul> <div class="_attribution">
