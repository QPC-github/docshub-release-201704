<h1>Broadcast Channel API</h1>
<div class="notice experimental"> <p> <strong>This is an experimental technology</strong><br>Because this technology's specification has not stabilized, check the <a href="#Browser_compatibility">compatibility table</a> for usage in various browsers. Also note that the syntax and behavior of an experimental technology is subject to change in future versions of browsers as the specification changes.</p> </div> <p>The <strong>Broadcast Channel API</strong> allows simple communication between <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/browsing_context" class="glossaryLink" title="browsing contexts: A browsing context is the environment in which a browser displays a Document (normally a tab nowadays, but possibly also a window or a frame within a page)." target="_blank">browsing contexts</a> (that is <em>windows</em>, <em>tabs</em>, <em>frames</em>, or <em>iframes</em>) with the same <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/origin" class="glossaryLink" title="origin: Web content's origin is defined by the scheme (protocol), host (domain), and port of the URL used to access it. Two objects have the same origin only when the scheme, host, and port all match." target="_blank">origin</a> (usually pages from the same site).</p> <div class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> This feature is available in <a href="../web_workers_api/">Web Workers</a>.</div> <p>Broadcast channels are named and bound to a specific origin.</p> <p>By creating a <a href="../broadcastchannel/" title="The BroadcastChannel interface represents a named channel that any browsing context of a given origin can subscribe to. It allows communication between different documents (in different windows, tabs, frames or iframes) of the same origin. Messages are broadcasted via a message event fired at all BroadcastChannel objects listening to the channel."><code>BroadcastChannel</code></a> object, which is listening to the underlying channel, you are able to receive any message that has been posted to it. An interesting point is that you no longer have to maintain a reference to iframes or workers that you wish to communicate with. They can simply “subscribe” to particular channels by constructing a <a href="../broadcastchannel/" title="The BroadcastChannel interface represents a named channel that any browsing context of a given origin can subscribe to. It allows communication between different documents (in different windows, tabs, frames or iframes) of the same origin. Messages are broadcasted via a message event fired at all BroadcastChannel objects listening to the channel."><code>BroadcastChannel</code></a>, and have full-duplex (bi-directional) communication between all of them.</p> <p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9945/BroadcastChannel.png" alt="The principle of the Broadcast Channel API" style="height: 448px; width: 784px;"></p> <h2 id="Broadcast_Channel_interface">Broadcast Channel interface</h2> <h3 id="Creating_or_joining_a_channel">Creating or joining a channel</h3> <p>The <code>BroadcastChannel</code> interface is very simple. A client joins a specific broadcast channel by creating a <a href="../broadcastchannel/" title="The BroadcastChannel interface represents a named channel that any browsing context of a given origin can subscribe to. It allows communication between different documents (in different windows, tabs, frames or iframes) of the same origin. Messages are broadcasted via a message event fired at all BroadcastChannel objects listening to the channel."><code>BroadcastChannel</code></a> object. The <a href="../broadcastchannel/broadcastchannel/">constructor</a> takes one single parameter, the <em>name</em> of the channel, used to identify it. If it is the first to connect to a broadcast channel, the underlying resource is created.</p> <pre data-language="js">// Connection to a broadcast channel
var bc = new BroadcastChannel('test_channel');
</pre> <h3 id="Sending_a_message">Sending a message</h3> <p>Posting a message is now trivial, it is enough to call the <a href="../broadcastchannel/postmessage/" title="The BroadcastChannel.postMessage() sends a message, which can be of any kind of Object, to each listener in any browser context with the same origin. The message is transmitted as a message event targeted at each BroadcastChannel bound to the channel."><code>postMessage()</code></a> method on the <code>BroadcastChannel</code> object. This method takes any object as argument, a very simple one like a <a href="../domstring/" title="DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String."><code>DOMString</code></a> text message, for example:</p> <pre data-language="js">// Example of sending of a very simple message
bc.postMessage('This is a test message.');
</pre> <p>There is no need for the message to be just a <a href="../domstring/" title="DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String."><code>DOMString</code></a>, any kind of object can be send. As the API doesn't associated any semantic to the messages, it is up to the participant to the channel to know what kind of messages to expect and what to do with them.</p> <h3 id="Receiving_a_message">Receiving a message</h3> <p>When a message is posted, a <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/message" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/message" target="_blank">message</a></code> event will be dispatched to each <a href="../broadcastchannel/" title="The BroadcastChannel interface represents a named channel that any browsing context of a given origin can subscribe to. It allows communication between different documents (in different windows, tabs, frames or iframes) of the same origin. Messages are broadcasted via a message event fired at all BroadcastChannel objects listening to the channel."><code>BroadcastChannel</code></a> object connected to this channel. There is no action by default, but a new function can be implemented using the <a href="../broadcastchannel/onmessage/" title="The BroadcastChannel.onmessage event handler is a property that specifies the function to execute when a message event, of type MessageEvent, is received by this BroadcastChannel. Such an event is sent by the browser with a message broadcasted to the channel."><code>onmessage</code></a> event handler.</p> <pre data-language="js">// Exemple of a simple event handler that only
// logs the event to the console
bc.onmessage = function (ev) { console.log(ev); }
</pre> <h3 id="Disconnecting_a_channel">Disconnecting a channel</h3> <p>To leave a channel, it is required to call the <a href="../broadcastchannel/close/" title="The BroadcastChannel.close() terminates the connection to the underlying channel, allowing the object to be garbage collected. This is a necessary step to perform as there is no other way for a browser to know that this channel is not needed anymore."><code>close()</code></a> method on the object. This disconnects the link between the object and the underlying channel and allows garbage collection to happen.</p> <pre data-language="js">// Disconnect the channel
bc.close()
</pre> <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>The Broadcast Channel API is a very simple API and the self-contained interface allows cross-context communication. It can be used to detect user actions in other tabs within a same site origin environment, like when the user logs into an account. The messaging protocol is not defined and the different documents in the different contexts need to implement it themselves: there is no negotiation, nor requirement from the specification.</p> <h2 id="Specifications">Specifications</h2> <table class="standard-table"> <tbody> <tr> <th scope="col">Specification</th> <th scope="col">Status</th> <th scope="col">Comment</th> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#broadcasting-to-other-browsing-contexts" class="external" lang="en" hreflang="en" target="_blank">WHATWG HTML Living Standard<br><small lang="en-US">The definition of 'The Broadcast Channel API' in that specification.</small></a></td> <td><span class="spec-Living">Living Standard</span></td> <td>Initial definition.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="Browser_compatibility">Browser compatibility</h2>  <div id="compat-desktop"> <table class="compat-table"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Chrome</th> <th>Firefox (Gecko)</th> <th>Internet Explorer</th> <th>Opera</th> <th>Safari</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Basic support</td> <td>54</td> <td>
