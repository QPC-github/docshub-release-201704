<h1>Performance Timeline</h1> <p>The <strong>Performance Timeline</strong> API defines extensions to the <a title="The Performance interface represents timing-related performance information for the given page." href="../performance/"><code>Performance</code></a> interface to support client-side latency measurements within applications. The extensions provide interfaces to retrieve <a title="The PerformanceEntry object encapsulates a single performance metric that is part of the performance timeline.
