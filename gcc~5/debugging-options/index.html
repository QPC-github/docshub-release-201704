<h1 class="section" id="Debugging-Options">3.9 Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC</h1> <p> GCC has various special options that are used for debugging either your program or GCC: </p>
<dl> <dt><code>-g</code></dt>
<dd>
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2). GDB can work with this debugging information. <p>On most systems that use stabs format, <code>-g</code> enables use of extra debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information makes debugging work better in GDB but probably makes other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program. If you want to control for certain whether to generate the extra information, use <code>-gstabs+</code>, <code>-gstabs</code>, <code>-gxcoff+</code>, <code>-gxcoff</code>, or <code>-gvms</code> (see below). </p>
<p>GCC allows you to use <code>-g</code> with <code>-O</code>. The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it; some statements may not be executed because they compute constant results or their values are already at hand; some statements may execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops. </p>
<p>Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output. This makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs. </p>
<p>The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the capability for more than one debugging format. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gsplit-dwarf</code></dt>
<dd>
Separate as much dwarf debugging information as possible into a separate output file with the extension .dwo. This option allows the build system to avoid linking files with debug information. To be useful, this option requires a debugger capable of reading .dwo files. </dd>
<dt><code>-ggdb</code></dt>
<dd>
Produce debugging information for use by GDB. This means to use the most expressive format available (DWARF 2, stabs, or the native format if neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions if at all possible. </dd>
<dt><code>-gpubnames</code></dt>
<dd>
Generate dwarf .debug_pubnames and .debug_pubtypes sections. </dd>
<dt><code>-ggnu-pubnames</code></dt>
<dd>
Generate .debug_pubnames and .debug_pubtypes sections in a format suitable for conversion into a GDB index. This option is only useful with a linker that can produce GDB index version 7. </dd>
<dt><code>-gstabs</code></dt>
<dd>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported), without GDB extensions. This is the format used by DBX on most BSD systems. On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option produces stabs debugging output that is not understood by DBX or SDB. On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU assembler. </dd>
<dt><code>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</code></dt>
<dd>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported), for only symbols that are actually used. </dd>
<dt><code>-femit-class-debug-always</code></dt>
<dd>
Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in only one object file, emit it in all object files using the class. This option should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way GCC normally emits debugging information for classes because using this option increases the size of debugging information by as much as a factor of two. </dd>
<dt><code>-fdebug-types-section</code></dt>
<dd>
When using DWARF Version 4 or higher, type DIEs can be put into their own <code>.debug_types</code> section instead of making them part of the <code>.debug_info</code> section. It is more efficient to put them in a separate comdat sections since the linker can then remove duplicates. But not all DWARF consumers support <code>.debug_types</code> sections yet and on some objects <code>.debug_types</code> produces larger instead of smaller debugging information. </dd>
<dt><code>-gstabs+</code></dt>
<dd>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB). The use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program. </dd>
<dt><code>-gcoff</code></dt>
<dd>
Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is supported). This is the format used by SDB on most System V systems prior to System V Release 4. </dd>
<dt><code>-gxcoff</code></dt>
<dd>
Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported). This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems. </dd>
<dt><code>-gxcoff+</code></dt>
<dd>
Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB). The use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the GNU assembler (GAS) to fail with an error. </dd>
<dt>
<code>-gdwarf-</code><var>version</var>
</dt>
<dd>
Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is supported). The value of <var>version</var> may be either 2, 3, 4 or 5; the default version for most targets is 4. DWARF Version 5 is only experimental. <p>Note that with DWARF Version 2, some ports require and always use some non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in the unwind tables. </p>
<p>Version 4 may require GDB 7.0 and <code>-fvar-tracking-assignments</code> for maximum benefit. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-grecord-gcc-switches</code></dt>
<dd>
This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke the compiler that may affect code generation to be appended to the DW_AT_producer attribute in DWARF debugging information. The options are concatenated with spaces separating them from each other and from the compiler version. See also <code>-frecord-gcc-switches</code> for another way of storing compiler options into the object file. This is the default. </dd>
<dt><code>-gno-record-gcc-switches</code></dt>
<dd>
Disallow appending command-line options to the DW_AT_producer attribute in DWARF debugging information. </dd>
<dt><code>-gstrict-dwarf</code></dt>
<dd>
Disallow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected with <samp><span class="option">-gdwarf-</span><var>version</var></samp>. On most targets using non-conflicting DWARF extensions from later standard versions is allowed. </dd>
<dt><code>-gno-strict-dwarf</code></dt>
<dd>
Allow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected with <samp><span class="option">-gdwarf-</span><var>version</var></samp>. </dd>
<dt>
<code>-gz</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>=</code><var>type</var><span class="roman">]</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Produce compressed debug sections in DWARF format, if that is supported. If <var>type</var> is not given, the default type depends on the capabilities of the assembler and linker used. <var>type</var> may be one of ‘<code>none</code>’ (don't compress debug sections), ‘<code>zlib</code>’ (use zlib compression in ELF gABI format), or ‘<code>zlib-gnu</code>’ (use zlib compression in traditional GNU format). If the linker doesn't support writing compressed debug sections, the option is rejected. Otherwise, if the assembler does not support them, <code>-gz</code> is silently ignored when producing object files. </dd>
<dt><code>-gvms</code></dt>
<dd>
Produce debugging information in Alpha/VMS debug format (if that is supported). This is the format used by DEBUG on Alpha/VMS systems. </dd>
<dt>
<code>-g</code><var>level</var><dt>
<code>-ggdb</code><var>level</var><dt>
<code>-gstabs</code><var>level</var><dt>
<code>-gcoff</code><var>level</var><dt>
<code>-gxcoff</code><var>level</var><dt>
<code>-gvms</code><var>level</var>
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>Request debugging information and also use <var>level</var> to specify how much information. The default level is 2. <p>Level 0 produces no debug information at all. Thus, <code>-g0</code> negates <code>-g</code>. </p>
<p>Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in parts of the program that you don't plan to debug. This includes descriptions of functions and external variables, and line number tables, but no information about local variables. </p>
<p>Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions present in the program. Some debuggers support macro expansion when you use <code>-g3</code>. </p>
<p><code>-gdwarf-2</code> does not accept a concatenated debug level, because GCC used to support an option <code>-gdwarf</code> that meant to generate debug information in version 1 of the DWARF format (which is very different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing. That debug format is long obsolete, but the option cannot be changed now. Instead use an additional <samp><span class="option">-g</span><var>level</var></samp> option to change the debug level for DWARF. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gtoggle</code></dt>
<dd>
Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option generates it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise. The position of this argument in the command line does not matter; it takes effect after all other options are processed, and it does so only once, no matter how many times it is given. This is mainly intended to be used with <code>-fcompare-debug</code>. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=address</code></dt>
<dd>
Enable AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector. Memory access instructions are instrumented to detect out-of-bounds and use-after-free bugs. See <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer" target="_blank">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer</a> for more details. The run-time behavior can be influenced using the <code>ASAN_OPTIONS</code> environment variable. When set to <code>help=1</code>, the available options are shown at startup of the instrumended program. See <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags#run-time-flags" target="_blank">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags#run-time-flags</a> for a list of supported options. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=kernel-address</code></dt>
<dd>
Enable AddressSanitizer for Linux kernel. See <a href="https://github.com/google/kasan/wiki" target="_blank">https://github.com/google/kasan/wiki</a> for more details. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=thread</code></dt>
<dd>
Enable ThreadSanitizer, a fast data race detector. Memory access instructions are instrumented to detect data race bugs. See <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki#threadsanitizer" target="_blank">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki#threadsanitizer</a> for more details. The run-time behavior can be influenced using the <code>TSAN_OPTIONS</code> environment variable; see <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags" target="_blank">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags</a> for a list of supported options. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=leak</code></dt>
<dd>
Enable LeakSanitizer, a memory leak detector. This option only matters for linking of executables and if neither <code>-fsanitize=address</code> nor <code>-fsanitize=thread</code> is used. In that case the executable is linked against a library that overrides <code>malloc</code> and other allocator functions. See <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer" target="_blank">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer</a> for more details. The run-time behavior can be influenced using the <code>LSAN_OPTIONS</code> environment variable. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=undefined</code></dt>
<dd>
Enable UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, a fast undefined behavior detector. Various computations are instrumented to detect undefined behavior at runtime. Current suboptions are: <dl> <dt><code>-fsanitize=shift</code></dt>
<dd>
This option enables checking that the result of a shift operation is not undefined. Note that what exactly is considered undefined differs slightly between C and C++, as well as between ISO C90 and C99, etc. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=integer-divide-by-zero</code></dt>
<dd>
Detect integer division by zero as well as <code>INT_MIN / -1</code> division. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=unreachable</code></dt>
<dd>
With this option, the compiler turns the <code>__builtin_unreachable</code> call into a diagnostics message call instead. When reaching the <code>__builtin_unreachable</code> call, the behavior is undefined. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=vla-bound</code></dt>
<dd>
This option instructs the compiler to check that the size of a variable length array is positive. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=null</code></dt>
<dd>
This option enables pointer checking. Particularly, the application built with this option turned on will issue an error message when it tries to dereference a NULL pointer, or if a reference (possibly an rvalue reference) is bound to a NULL pointer, or if a method is invoked on an object pointed by a NULL pointer. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=return</code></dt>
<dd>
This option enables return statement checking. Programs built with this option turned on will issue an error message when the end of a non-void function is reached without actually returning a value. This option works in C++ only. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow</code></dt>
<dd>
This option enables signed integer overflow checking. We check that the result of <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, and both unary and binary <code>-</code> does not overflow in the signed arithmetics. Note, integer promotion rules must be taken into account. That is, the following is not an overflow: <pre class="smallexample">signed char a = SCHAR_MAX;
a++;</pre> </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=bounds</code></dt>
<dd>
This option enables instrumentation of array bounds. Various out of bounds accesses are detected. Flexible array members, flexible array member-like arrays, and initializers of variables with static storage are not instrumented. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=alignment</code></dt>
<dd>
 This option enables checking of alignment of pointers when they are dereferenced, or when a reference is bound to insufficiently aligned target, or when a method or constructor is invoked on insufficiently aligned object. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=object-size</code></dt>
<dd>
This option enables instrumentation of memory references using the <code>__builtin_object_size</code> function. Various out of bounds pointer accesses are detected. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</code></dt>
<dd>
Detect floating-point division by zero. Unlike other similar options, <code>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</code> is not enabled by <code>-fsanitize=undefined</code>, since floating-point division by zero can be a legitimate way of obtaining infinities and NaNs. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</code></dt>
<dd>
This option enables floating-point type to integer conversion checking. We check that the result of the conversion does not overflow. Unlike other similar options, <code>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</code> is not enabled by <code>-fsanitize=undefined</code>. This option does not work well with <code>FE_INVALID</code> exceptions enabled. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=nonnull-attribute</code></dt>
<dd>
 This option enables instrumentation of calls, checking whether null values are not passed to arguments marked as requiring a non-null value by the <code>nonnull</code> function attribute. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=returns-nonnull-attribute</code></dt>
<dd>
 This option enables instrumentation of return statements in functions marked with <code>returns_nonnull</code> function attribute, to detect returning of null values from such functions. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=bool</code></dt>
<dd>
 This option enables instrumentation of loads from bool. If a value other than 0/1 is loaded, a run-time error is issued. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=enum</code></dt>
<dd>
 This option enables instrumentation of loads from an enum type. If a value outside the range of values for the enum type is loaded, a run-time error is issued. </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=vptr</code></dt>
<dd>
 This option enables instrumentation of C++ member function calls, member accesses and some conversions between pointers to base and derived classes, to verify the referenced object has the correct dynamic type. </dd>
</dl> <p>While <code>-ftrapv</code> causes traps for signed overflows to be emitted, <code>-fsanitize=undefined</code> gives a diagnostic message. This currently works only for the C family of languages. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-sanitize=all</code></dt>
<dd>
 This option disables all previously enabled sanitizers. <code>-fsanitize=all</code> is not allowed, as some sanitizers cannot be used together. </dd>
<dt>
<code>-fasan-shadow-offset=</code><var>number</var>
</dt>
<dd>
This option forces GCC to use custom shadow offset in AddressSanitizer checks. It is useful for experimenting with different shadow memory layouts in Kernel AddressSanitizer. </dd>
<dt>
<code>-fsanitize-recover</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>=</code><var>opts</var><span class="roman">]</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<code>-fsanitize-recover=</code> controls error recovery mode for sanitizers mentioned in comma-separated list of <var>opts</var>. Enabling this option for a sanitizer component causes it to attempt to continue running the program as if no error happened. This means multiple runtime errors can be reported in a single program run, and the exit code of the program may indicate success even when errors have been reported. The <code>-fno-sanitize-recover=</code> option can be used to alter this behavior: only the first detected error is reported and program then exits with a non-zero exit code. <p>Currently this feature only works for <code>-fsanitize=undefined</code> (and its suboptions except for <code>-fsanitize=unreachable</code> and <code>-fsanitize=return</code>), <code>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</code>, <code>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</code> and <code>-fsanitize=kernel-address</code>. For these sanitizers error recovery is turned on by default. <code>-fsanitize-recover=all</code> and <code>-fno-sanitize-recover=all</code> is also accepted, the former enables recovery for all sanitizers that support it, the latter disables recovery for all sanitizers that support it. </p>
<p>Syntax without explicit <var>opts</var> parameter is deprecated. It is equivalent to </p>
<pre class="smallexample">-fsanitize-recover=undefined,float-cast-overflow,float-divide-by-zero</pre> <p class="noindent">Similarly <code>-fno-sanitize-recover</code> is equivalent to </p>
<pre class="smallexample">-fno-sanitize-recover=undefined,float-cast-overflow,float-divide-by-zero</pre> </dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error</code></dt>
<dd>
The <code>-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error</code> option instructs the compiler to report undefined behavior using <code>__builtin_trap</code> rather than a <code>libubsan</code> library routine. The advantage of this is that the <code>libubsan</code> library is not needed and is not linked in, so this is usable even in freestanding environments. </dd>
<dt><code>-fcheck-pointer-bounds</code></dt>
<dd>
Enable Pointer Bounds Checker instrumentation. Each memory reference is instrumented with checks of the pointer used for memory access against bounds associated with that pointer. <p>Currently there is only an implementation for Intel MPX available, thus x86 target and <code>-mmpx</code> are required to enable this feature. MPX-based instrumentation requires a runtime library to enable MPX in hardware and handle bounds violation signals. By default when <code>-fcheck-pointer-bounds</code> and <code>-mmpx</code> options are used to link a program, the GCC driver links against the <code>libmpx</code> runtime library and <code>libmpxwrappers</code> library. It also passes '-z bndplt' to a linker in case it supports this option (which is checked on libmpx configuration). Note that old versions of linker may ignore option. Gold linker doesn't support '-z bndplt' option. With no '-z bndplt' support in linker all calls to dynamic libraries lose passed bounds reducing overall protection level. It's highly recommended to use linker with '-z bndplt' support. In case such linker is not available it is adviced to always use <code>-static-libmpxwrappers</code> for better protection level or use <code>-static</code> to completely avoid external calls to dynamic libraries. MPX-based instrumentation may be used for debugging and also may be included in production code to increase program security. Depending on usage, you may have different requirements for the runtime library. The current version of the MPX runtime library is more oriented for use as a debugging tool. MPX runtime library usage implies <code>-lpthread</code>. See also <code>-static-libmpx</code>. The runtime library behavior can be influenced using various <code>CHKP_RT_*</code> environment variables. See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Intel%20MPX%20support%20in%20the%20GCC%20compiler" target="_blank">https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Intel%20MPX%20support%20in%20the%20GCC%20compiler</a> for more details. </p>
<p>Generated instrumentation may be controlled by various <code>-fchkp-*</code> options and by the <code>bnd_variable_size</code> structure field attribute (see <a href="../type-attributes/#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>) and <code>bnd_legacy</code>, and <code>bnd_instrument</code> function attributes (see <a href="../function-attributes/#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>). GCC also provides a number of built-in functions for controlling the Pointer Bounds Checker. See <a href="../pointer-bounds-checker-builtins/#Pointer-Bounds-Checker-builtins">Pointer Bounds Checker builtins</a>, for more information. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-check-incomplete-type</code></dt>
<dd>
Generate pointer bounds checks for variables with incomplete type. Enabled by default. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-narrow-bounds</code></dt>
<dd>
Controls bounds used by Pointer Bounds Checker for pointers to object fields. If narrowing is enabled then field bounds are used. Otherwise object bounds are used. See also <code>-fchkp-narrow-to-innermost-array</code> and <code>-fchkp-first-field-has-own-bounds</code>. Enabled by default. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-first-field-has-own-bounds</code></dt>
<dd>
Forces Pointer Bounds Checker to use narrowed bounds for the address of the first field in the structure. By default a pointer to the first field has the same bounds as a pointer to the whole structure. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-narrow-to-innermost-array</code></dt>
<dd>
Forces Pointer Bounds Checker to use bounds of the innermost arrays in case of nested static array access. By default this option is disabled and bounds of the outermost array are used. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-optimize</code></dt>
<dd>
Enables Pointer Bounds Checker optimizations. Enabled by default at optimization levels <code>-O</code>, <code>-O2</code>, <code>-O3</code>. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-use-fast-string-functions</code></dt>
<dd>
Enables use of <code>*_nobnd</code> versions of string functions (not copying bounds) by Pointer Bounds Checker. Disabled by default. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-use-nochk-string-functions</code></dt>
<dd>
Enables use of <code>*_nochk</code> versions of string functions (not checking bounds) by Pointer Bounds Checker. Disabled by default. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-use-static-bounds</code></dt>
<dd>
Allow Pointer Bounds Checker to generate static bounds holding bounds of static variables. Enabled by default. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-use-static-const-bounds</code></dt>
<dd>
Use statically-initialized bounds for constant bounds instead of generating them each time they are required. By default enabled when <code>-fchkp-use-static-bounds</code> is enabled. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-treat-zero-dynamic-size-as-infinite</code></dt>
<dd>
With this option, objects with incomplete type whose dynamically-obtained size is zero are treated as having infinite size instead by Pointer Bounds Checker. This option may be helpful if a program is linked with a library missing size information for some symbols. Disabled by default. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-check-read</code></dt>
<dd>
Instructs Pointer Bounds Checker to generate checks for all read accesses to memory. Enabled by default. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-check-write</code></dt>
<dd>
Instructs Pointer Bounds Checker to generate checks for all write accesses to memory. Enabled by default. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-store-bounds</code></dt>
<dd>
Instructs Pointer Bounds Checker to generate bounds stores for pointer writes. Enabled by default. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-instrument-calls</code></dt>
<dd>
Instructs Pointer Bounds Checker to pass pointer bounds to calls. Enabled by default. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-instrument-marked-only</code></dt>
<dd>
Instructs Pointer Bounds Checker to instrument only functions marked with the <code>bnd_instrument</code> attribute (see <a href="../function-attributes/#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>). Disabled by default. </dd>
<dt><code>-fchkp-use-wrappers</code></dt>
<dd>
Allows Pointer Bounds Checker to replace calls to built-in functions with calls to wrapper functions. When <code>-fchkp-use-wrappers</code> is used to link a program, the GCC driver automatically links against <code>libmpxwrappers</code>. See also <code>-static-libmpxwrappers</code>. Enabled by default. </dd>
<dt>
<code>-fdump-final-insns</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>=</code><var>file</var><span class="roman">]</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Dump the final internal representation (RTL) to <var>file</var>. If the optional argument is omitted (or if <var>file</var> is <code>.</code>), the name of the dump file is determined by appending <code>.gkd</code> to the compilation output file name. </dd>
<dt>
<code>-fcompare-debug</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>=</code><var>opts</var><span class="roman">]</span>
</dt>

If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a second time, adding <var>opts</var> and <code>-fcompare-debug-second</code> to the arguments passed to the second compilation. Dump the final internal representation in both compilations, and print an error if they differ. <p>If the equal sign is omitted, the default <code>-gtoggle</code> is used. </p>
<p>The environment variable <code>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</code>, if defined, non-empty and nonzero, implicitly enables <code>-fcompare-debug</code>. If <code>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</code> is defined to a string starting with a dash, then it is used for <var>opts</var>, otherwise the default <code>-gtoggle</code> is used. </p>
<p><code>-fcompare-debug=</code>, with the equal sign but without <var>opts</var>, is equivalent to <code>-fno-compare-debug</code>, which disables the dumping of the final representation and the second compilation, preventing even <code>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</code> from taking effect. </p>
<p>To verify full coverage during <code>-fcompare-debug</code> testing, set <code>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</code> to say <code>-fcompare-debug-not-overridden</code>, which GCC rejects as an invalid option in any actual compilation (rather than preprocessing, assembly or linking). To get just a warning, setting <code>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</code> to ‘<code>-w%n-fcompare-debug not overridden</code>’ will do. </p>

<dt><code>-fcompare-debug-second</code></dt>
<dd>
This option is implicitly passed to the compiler for the second compilation requested by <code>-fcompare-debug</code>, along with options to silence warnings, and omitting other options that would cause side-effect compiler outputs to files or to the standard output. Dump files and preserved temporary files are renamed so as to contain the <code>.gk</code> additional extension during the second compilation, to avoid overwriting those generated by the first. <p>When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it causes the <em>first</em> compilation to be skipped, which makes it useful for little other than debugging the compiler proper. </p>

Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the base name of the compilation source file matches the base name of file in which the type is defined, unless the struct is a template or defined in a system header. <p>This option significantly reduces the size of debugging information, with some potential loss in type information to the debugger. See <code>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</code> for a more aggressive option. See <code>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</code> for more detailed control. </p>

</dt>
<dd>
Specify the struct-like types for which the compiler generates debug information. The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug information between different object files within the same program. <p>This option is a detailed version of <code>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</code> and <code>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</code>, which serves for most needs. </p>
<p>A specification has the syntax [‘<code>dir:</code>’|‘<code>ind:</code>’][‘<code>ord:</code>’|‘<code>gen:</code>’](‘<code>any</code>’|‘<code>sys</code>’|‘<code>base</code>’|‘<code>none</code>’) </p>
<p>The optional first word limits the specification to structs that are used directly (‘<code>dir:</code>’) or used indirectly (‘<code>ind:</code>’). A struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member. Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs. That is, when use of an incomplete struct is valid, the use is indirect. An example is ‘<code>struct one direct; struct two * indirect;</code>’. </p>
<p>The optional second word limits the specification to ordinary structs (‘<code>ord:</code>’) or generic structs (‘<code>gen:</code>’). Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain. For C++, these are non-explicit specializations of template classes, or non-template classes within the above. Other programming languages have generics, but <code>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</code> does not yet implement them. </p>
<p>The third word specifies the source files for those structs for which the compiler should emit debug information. The values ‘<code>none</code>’ and ‘<code>any</code>’ have the normal meaning. The value ‘<code>base</code>’ means that the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears must match the base of the name of the main compilation file. In practice, this means that when compiling <code>foo.c</code>, debug information is generated for types declared in that file and <code>foo.h</code>, but not other header files. The value ‘<code>sys</code>’ means those types satisfying ‘<code>base</code>’ or declared in system or compiler headers. </p>
<p>You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application. </p>
<p>The default is <code>-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all</code>. </p>
<p>This option works only with DWARF 2. </p>

<dd>
Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the program, on a per-function basis. The filename for the dump is made by appending <code>.su</code> to the <var>auxname</var>. <var>auxname</var> is generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the basename of the source file. An entry is made up of three fields: <ul> <li>The name of the function. </li>
<li>A number of bytes. </li>
<li>One or more qualifiers: <code>static</code>, <code>dynamic</code>, <code>bounded</code>. </li>
</ul> <p>The qualifier <code>static</code> means that the function manipulates the stack statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on function entry and released on function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made in the function. The second field is this fixed number of bytes. </p>
<p>The qualifier <code>dynamic</code> means that the function manipulates the stack dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described above, stack adjustments are made in the body of the function, for example to push/pop arguments around function calls. If the qualifier <code>bounded</code> is also present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile time and the second field is an upper bound of the total amount of stack used by the function. If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is not bounded at compile time and the second field only represents the bounded part. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fprofile-arcs</code></dt>
<dd>
Add code so that program flow arcs are instrumented. During execution the program records how many times each branch and call is executed and how many times it is taken or returns. When the compiled program exits it saves this data to a file called <samp><var>auxname</var><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> for each source file. The data may be used for profile-directed optimizations (<code>-fbranch-probabilities</code>), or for test coverage analysis (<code>-ftest-coverage</code>). Each object file's <var>auxname</var> is generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is the basename of the source file. In both cases any suffix is removed (e.g. <code>foo.gcda</code> for input file <code>dir/foo.c</code>, or <code>dir/foo.gcda</code> for output file specified as <code>-o dir/foo.o</code>). See <a href="../cross_002dprofiling/#Cross_002dprofiling">Cross-profiling</a>.

<dt><code>--coverage</code></dt>
<dd>
 This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for coverage analysis. The option is a synonym for <code>-fprofile-arcs</code> <code>-ftest-coverage</code> (when compiling) and <code>-lgcov</code> (when linking). See the documentation for those options for more details. <ul> <li>Compile the source files with <code>-fprofile-arcs</code> plus optimization and code generation options. For test coverage analysis, use the additional <code>-ftest-coverage</code> option. You do not need to profile every source file in a program. </li>
<li>Link your object files with <code>-lgcov</code> or <code>-fprofile-arcs</code> (the latter implies the former). </li>
<li>Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile information. This may be repeated any number of times. You can run concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated. Also <code>fork</code> calls are detected and correctly handled (double counting will not happen). </li>
<li>For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with the same optimization and code generation options plus <code>-fbranch-probabilities</code> (see <a href="../optimize-options/#Optimize-Options">Options that Control Optimization</a>). </li>
<li>For test coverage analysis, use <code>gcov</code> to produce human readable information from the <code>.gcno</code> and <code>.gcda</code> files. Refer to the <code>gcov</code> documentation for further information. </li>
</ul> <p>With <code>-fprofile-arcs</code>, for each function of your program GCC creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph. Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are executed. When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic block must be created to hold the instrumentation code. </p>

Produce a notes file that the <code>gcov</code> code-coverage utility (see <a href="../gcov/#Gcov"><code>gcov</code>—a Test Coverage Program</a>) can use to show program coverage. Each source file's note file is called <samp><var>auxname</var><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp>. Refer to the <code>-fprofile-arcs</code> option above for a description of <var>auxname</var> and instructions on how to generate test coverage data. Coverage data matches the source files more closely if you do not optimize. </dd>

All debug counters have the initial upper bound of <code>UINT_MAX</code>; thus <code>dbg_cnt</code> returns true always unless the upper bound is set by this option. For example, with <code>-fdbg-cnt=dce:10,tail_call:0</code>, <code>dbg_cnt(dce)</code> returns true only for first 10 invocations. </dd>

Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by <var>letters</var>. This is used for debugging the RTL-based passes of the compiler. The file names for most of the dumps are made by appending a pass number and a word to the <var>dumpname</var>, and the files are created in the directory of the output file. In case of <samp><span class="option">=</span><var>filename</var></samp> option, the dump is output on the given file instead of the pass numbered dump files. Note that the pass number is computed statically as passes get registered into the pass manager. Thus the numbering is not related to the dynamic order of execution of passes. In particular, a pass installed by a plugin could have a number over 200 even if it executed quite early. <var>dumpname</var> is generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the basename of the source file. These switches may have different effects when <code>-E</code> is used for preprocessing. <p>Debug dumps can be enabled with a <code>-fdump-rtl</code> switch or some <code>-d</code> option <var>letters</var>.

</dt>
<dd>
Enable and control dumping of pass statistics in a separate file. The file name is generated by appending a suffix ending in ‘<code>.statistics</code>’ to the source file name, and the file is created in the same directory as the output file. If the ‘<samp><span class="samp">-</span><var>option</var></samp>’ form is used, ‘<code>-stats</code>’ causes counters to be summed over the whole compilation unit while ‘<code>-details</code>’ dumps every event as the passes generate them.

<dd>
Control the dumping at various stages of processing the intermediate language tree to a file. The file name is generated by appending a switch-specific suffix to the source file name, and the file is created in the same directory as the output file. In case of <samp><span class="option">=</span><var>filename</var></samp> option, the dump is output on the given file instead of the auto named dump files. If the ‘<samp><span class="samp">-</span><var>options</var></samp>’ form is used, <var>options</var> is a list of ‘<code>-</code>’ separated options which control the details of the dump. Not all options are applicable to all dumps; those that are not meaningful are ignored. The following options are available <dl> <dt>‘<code>address</code>’</dt>
<dd>Print the address of each node. Usually this is not meaningful as it changes according to the environment and source file. Its primary use is for tying up a dump file with a debug environment. </dd>
<dt>‘<code>asmname</code>’</dt>
<dd>If <code>DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME</code> has been set for a given decl, use that in the dump instead of <code>DECL_NAME</code>. Its primary use is ease of use working backward from mangled names in the assembly file. </dd>
<dt>‘<code>slim</code>’</dt>
<dd>When dumping front-end intermediate representations, inhibit dumping of members of a scope or body of a function merely because that scope has been reached. Only dump such items when they are directly reachable by some other path. <p>When dumping pretty-printed trees, this option inhibits dumping the bodies of control structures. </p>

</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Controls optimization dumps from various optimization passes. If the ‘<samp><span class="samp">-</span><var>options</var></samp>’ form is used, <var>options</var> is a list of ‘<code>-</code>’ separated option keywords to select the dump details and optimizations. <p>The <var>options</var> can be divided into two groups: options describing the verbosity of the dump, and options describing which optimizations should be included. The options from both the groups can be freely mixed as they are non-overlapping. However, in case of any conflicts, the later options override the earlier options on the command line. </p>
<p>The following options control the dump verbosity: </p>
<dl> <dt>‘<code>optimized</code>’</dt>
<dd>Print information when an optimization is successfully applied. It is up to a pass to decide which information is relevant. For example, the vectorizer passes print the source location of loops which are successfully vectorized. </dd>
<dt>‘<code>missed</code>’</dt>
<dd>Print information about missed optimizations. Individual passes control which information to include in the output. </dd>
<dt>‘<code>note</code>’</dt>
<dd>Print verbose information about optimizations, such as certain transformations, more detailed messages about decisions etc. </dd>
<dt>‘<code>all</code>’</dt>
<dd>Print detailed optimization information. This includes ‘<code>optimized</code>’, ‘<code>missed</code>’, and ‘<code>note</code>’. </dd>
</dl> <p>One or more of the following option keywords can be used to describe a group of optimizations: </p>
<dl> <dt>‘<code>ipa</code>’</dt>
<dd>Enable dumps from all interprocedural optimizations. </dd>
<dt>‘<code>loop</code>’</dt>
<dd>Enable dumps from all loop optimizations. </dd>
<dt>‘<code>inline</code>’</dt>
<dd>Enable dumps from all inlining optimizations. </dd>
<dt>‘<code>vec</code>’</dt>
<dd>Enable dumps from all vectorization optimizations. </dd>
<dt>‘<code>optall</code>’</dt>
<dd>Enable dumps from all optimizations. This is a superset of the optimization groups listed above. </dd>
</dl> <p>If <var>options</var> is omitted, it defaults to ‘<code>optimized-optall</code>’, which means to dump all info about successful optimizations from all the passes. </p>
<p>If the <var>filename</var> is provided, then the dumps from all the applicable optimizations are concatenated into the <var>filename</var>. Otherwise the dump is output onto <code>stderr</code>. Though multiple <code>-fopt-info</code> options are accepted, only one of them can include a <var>filename</var>. If other filenames are provided then all but the first such option are ignored. </p>
<p>Note that the output <var>filename</var> is overwritten in case of multiple translation units. If a combined output from multiple translation units is desired, <code>stderr</code> should be used instead. </p>
<p>In the following example, the optimization info is output to <code>stderr</code>: </p>
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -O3 -fopt-info</pre> <p>This example: </p>
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -O3 -fopt-info-missed=missed.all</pre> <p class="noindent">outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into <code>missed.all</code>, and this one: </p>
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-vec-missed</pre> <p class="noindent">prints information about missed optimization opportunities from vectorization passes on <code>stderr</code>. Note that <code>-fopt-info-vec-missed</code> is equivalent to <code>-fopt-info-missed-vec</code>. </p>
<p>As another example, </p>
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -O3 -fopt-info-inline-optimized-missed=inline.txt</pre> <p class="noindent">outputs information about missed optimizations as well as optimized locations from all the inlining passes into <code>inline.txt</code>. </p>
<p>Finally, consider: </p>
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -fopt-info-vec-missed=vec.miss -fopt-info-loop-optimized=loop.opt</pre> <p class="noindent">Here the two output filenames <code>vec.miss</code> and <code>loop.opt</code> are in conflict since only one output file is allowed. In this case, only the first option takes effect and the subsequent options are ignored. Thus only <code>vec.miss</code> is produced which contains dumps from the vectorizer about missed opportunities. </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>-frandom-seed=</code><var>string</var>
</dt>
<dd>
This option provides a seed that GCC uses in place of random numbers in generating certain symbol names that have to be different in every compiled file. It is also used to place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that produce them. You can use the <code>-frandom-seed</code> option to produce reproducibly identical object files. <p>The <var>string</var> can either be a number (decimal, octal or hex) or an arbitrary string (in which case it's converted to a number by computing CRC32). </p>
<p>The <var>string</var> should be different for every file you compile. </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>-fsched-verbose=</code><var>n</var>
</dt>
<dd>
On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the amount of debugging output the scheduler prints. This information is written to standard error, unless <code>-fdump-rtl-sched1</code> or <code>-fdump-rtl-sched2</code> is specified, in which case it is output to the usual dump listing file, <code>.sched1</code> or <code>.sched2</code> respectively. However for <var>n</var> greater than nine, the output is always printed to standard error. <p>For <var>n</var> greater than zero, <code>-fsched-verbose</code> outputs the same information as <code>-fdump-rtl-sched1</code> and <code>-fdump-rtl-sched2</code>. For <var>n</var> greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities, detailed ready list information and unit/insn info. For <var>n</var> greater than two, it includes RTL at abort point, control-flow and regions info. And for <var>n</var> over four, <code>-fsched-verbose</code> also includes dependence info. </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>-save-temps</code><dt><code>-save-temps=cwd</code></dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Store the usual “temporary” intermediate files permanently; place them in the current directory and name them based on the source file. Thus, compiling <code>foo.c</code> with <code>-c -save-temps</code> produces files <code>foo.i</code> and <code>foo.s</code>, as well as <code>foo.o</code>. This creates a preprocessed <code>foo.i</code> output file even though the compiler now normally uses an integrated preprocessor. <p>When used in combination with the <code>-x</code> command-line option, <code>-save-temps</code> is sensible enough to avoid over writing an input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file. The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the source file before using <code>-save-temps</code>. </p>
<p>If you invoke GCC in parallel, compiling several different source files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or the same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it is likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with each other, and overwrite the temporary files. For instance: </p>
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -save-temps -o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&amp;
gcc -save-temps -o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&amp;</pre> <p>may result in <code>foo.i</code> and <code>foo.o</code> being written to simultaneously by both compilers. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-save-temps=obj</code></dt>
<dd>
Store the usual “temporary” intermediate files permanently. If the <code>-o</code> option is used, the temporary files are based on the object file. If the <code>-o</code> option is not used, the <code>-save-temps=obj</code> switch behaves like <code>-save-temps</code>. <p>For example: </p>
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -save-temps=obj -c foo.c
gcc -save-temps=obj -c bar.c -o dir/xbar.o
gcc -save-temps=obj foobar.c -o dir2/yfoobar</pre> <p class="noindent">creates <code>foo.i</code>, <code>foo.s</code>, <code>dir/xbar.i</code>, <code>dir/xbar.s</code>, <code>dir2/yfoobar.i</code>, <code>dir2/yfoobar.s</code>, and <code>dir2/yfoobar.o</code>. </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>-time</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>=</code><var>file</var><span class="roman">]</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the compilation sequence. For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler (plus the linker if linking is done). <p>Without the specification of an output file, the output looks like this: </p>
<pre class="smallexample"># cc1 0.12 0.01
# as 0.00 0.01</pre> <p>The first number on each line is the “user time”, that is time spent executing the program itself. The second number is “system time”, time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program. Both numbers are in seconds. </p>
<p>With the specification of an output file, the output is appended to the named file, and it looks like this: </p>
<pre class="smallexample">0.12 0.01 cc1 <var>options</var>
0.00 0.01 as <var>options</var></pre> <p>The “user time” and the “system time” are moved before the program name, and the options passed to the program are displayed, so that one can later tell what file was being compiled, and with which options. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fvar-tracking</code></dt>
<dd>
Run variable tracking pass. It computes where variables are stored at each position in code. Better debugging information is then generated (if the debugging information format supports this information). <p>It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (<code>-Os</code>, <code>-O</code>, <code>-O2</code>, <small class="dots">...</small>), debugging information (<code>-g</code>) and the debug info format supports it. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fvar-tracking-assignments</code></dt>
<dd>
Annotate assignments to user variables early in the compilation and attempt to carry the annotations over throughout the compilation all the way to the end, in an attempt to improve debug information while optimizing. Use of <code>-gdwarf-4</code> is recommended along with it. <p>It can be enabled even if var-tracking is disabled, in which case annotations are created and maintained, but discarded at the end. By default, this flag is enabled together with <code>-fvar-tracking</code>, except when selective scheduling is enabled. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle</code></dt>
<dd>
Toggle <code>-fvar-tracking-assignments</code>, in the same way that <code>-gtoggle</code> toggles <code>-g</code>. </dd>
<dt>
<code>-print-file-name=</code><var>library</var>
</dt>
<dd>
Print the full absolute name of the library file <var>library</var> that would be used when linking—and don't do anything else. With this option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints the file name. </dd>
<dt><code>-print-multi-directory</code></dt>
<dd>
Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any other switches present in the command line. This directory is supposed to exist in <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code>. </dd>
<dt><code>-print-multi-lib</code></dt>
<dd>
Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches that enable them. The directory name is separated from the switches by ‘<code>;</code>’, and each switch starts with an ‘<code>@</code>’ instead of the ‘<code>-</code>’, without spaces between multiple switches. This is supposed to ease shell processing. </dd>
<dt><code>-print-multi-os-directory</code></dt>
<dd>
Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multilib, relative to some <code>lib</code> subdirectory. If OS libraries are present in the <code>lib</code> subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is usually just <code>.</code>, if OS libraries are present in <samp><span class="file">lib</span><var>suffix</var></samp> sibling directories this prints e.g. <code>../lib64</code>, <code>../lib</code> or <code>../lib32</code>, or if OS libraries are present in <samp><span class="file">lib/</span><var>subdir</var></samp> subdirectories it prints e.g. <code>amd64</code>, <code>sparcv9</code> or <code>ev6</code>. </dd>
<dt><code>-print-multiarch</code></dt>
<dd>
Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multiarch, relative to some <code>lib</code> subdirectory. </dd>
<dt>
<code>-print-prog-name=</code><var>program</var>
</dt>
<dd>
Like <code>-print-file-name</code>, but searches for a program such as <code>cpp</code>. </dd>
<dt><code>-print-libgcc-file-name</code></dt>
<dd>
Same as <code>-print-file-name=libgcc.a</code>. <p>This is useful when you use <code>-nostdlib</code> or <code>-nodefaultlibs</code> but you do want to link with <code>libgcc.a</code>. You can do: </p>
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -nostdlib <var>files</var>... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`</pre> </dd>
<dt><code>-print-search-dirs</code></dt>
<dd>
Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of program and library directories <code>gcc</code> searches—and don't do anything else. <p>This is useful when <code>gcc</code> prints the error message ‘<code>installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory</code>’. To resolve this you either need to put <code>cpp0</code> and the other compiler components where <code>gcc</code> expects to find them, or you can set the environment variable <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code> to the directory where you installed them. Don't forget the trailing ‘<code>/</code>’. See <a href="../environment-variables/#Environment-Variables">Environment Variables</a>. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-print-sysroot</code></dt>
<dd>
Print the target sysroot directory that is used during compilation. This is the target sysroot specified either at configure time or using the <code>--sysroot</code> option, possibly with an extra suffix that depends on compilation options. If no target sysroot is specified, the option prints nothing. </dd>
<dt><code>-print-sysroot-headers-suffix</code></dt>
<dd>
Print the suffix added to the target sysroot when searching for headers, or give an error if the compiler is not configured with such a suffix—and don't do anything else. </dd>
<dt><code>-dumpmachine</code></dt>
<dd>
Print the compiler's target machine (for example, ‘<code>i686-pc-linux-gnu</code>’)—and don't do anything else. </dd>
<dt><code>-dumpversion</code></dt>
<dd>
Print the compiler version (for example, <code>3.0</code>)—and don't do anything else. </dd>
<dt><code>-dumpspecs</code></dt>
<dd>
Print the compiler's built-in specs—and don't do anything else. (This is used when GCC itself is being built.) See <a href="../spec-files/#Spec-Files">Spec Files</a>. </dd>
<dt><code>-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types</code></dt>
<dd>
Normally, when producing DWARF 2 output, GCC avoids producing debug symbol output for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled. Sometimes it is useful to have GCC emit debugging information for all types declared in a compilation unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used in that compilation unit, for example if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is not actually used in your program (but is declared). More often, however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space. </dd>
