<h1 id="docker-and-the-device-mapper-storage-driver">Docker and the Device Mapper storage driver</h1> <p>Device Mapper is a kernel-based framework that underpins many advanced volume management technologies on Linux. Docker’s <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver leverages the thin provisioning and snapshotting capabilities of this framework for image and container management. This article refers to the Device Mapper storage driver as <code>devicemapper</code>, and the kernel framework as <code>Device Mapper</code>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong>: The <a href="https://www.docker.com/compatibility-maintenance" target="_blank">Commercially Supported Docker Engine (CS-Engine) running on RHEL and CentOS Linux</a> requires that you use the <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="an-alternative-to-aufs">An alternative to AUFS</h2> <p>Docker originally ran on Ubuntu and Debian Linux and used AUFS for its storage backend. As Docker became popular, many of the companies that wanted to use it were using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Unfortunately, because the upstream mainline Linux kernel did not include AUFS, RHEL did not use AUFS either.</p> <p>To correct this Red Hat developers investigated getting AUFS into the mainline kernel. Ultimately, though, they decided a better idea was to develop a new storage backend. Moreover, they would base this new storage backend on existing <code>Device Mapper</code> technology.</p> <p>Red Hat collaborated with Docker Inc. to contribute this new driver. As a result of this collaboration, Docker’s Engine was re-engineered to make the storage backend pluggable. So it was that the <code>devicemapper</code> became the second storage driver Docker supported.</p> <p>Device Mapper has been included in the mainline Linux kernel since version 2.6.9. It is a core part of RHEL family of Linux distributions. This means that the <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver is based on stable code that has a lot of real-world production deployments and strong community support.</p> <h2 id="image-layering-and-sharing">Image layering and sharing</h2> <p>The <code>devicemapper</code> driver stores every image and container on its own virtual device. These devices are thin-provisioned copy-on-write snapshot devices. Device Mapper technology works at the block level rather than the file level. This means that <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver’s thin provisioning and copy-on-write operations work with blocks rather than entire files.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Snapshots are also referred to as <em>thin devices</em> or <em>virtual devices</em>. They all mean the same thing in the context of the <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver.</p> </blockquote> <p>With <code>devicemapper</code> the high level process for creating images is as follows:</p> <ol> <li>
<p>The <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver creates a thin pool.</p> <p>The pool is created from block devices or loop mounted sparse files (more on this later).</p>
</li> <li>
<p>Next it creates a <em>base device</em>.</p> <p>A base device is a thin device with a filesystem. You can see which filesystem is in use by running the <code>docker info</code> command and checking the <code>Backing filesystem</code> value.</p>
</li> <li>
<p>Each new image (and image layer) is a snapshot of this base device.</p> <p>These are thin provisioned copy-on-write snapshots. This means that they are initially empty and only consume space from the pool when data is written to them.</p>
</li> </ol> <p>With <code>devicemapper</code>, container layers are snapshots of the image they are created from. Just as with images, container snapshots are thin provisioned copy-on-write snapshots. The container snapshot stores all updates to the container. The <code>devicemapper</code> allocates space to them on-demand from the pool as and when data is written to the container.</p> <p>The high level diagram below shows a thin pool with a base device and two images.</p> <p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/base_device.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>If you look closely at the diagram you’ll see that it’s snapshots all the way down. Each image layer is a snapshot of the layer below it. The lowest layer of each image is a snapshot of the base device that exists in the pool. This base device is a <code>Device Mapper</code> artifact and not a Docker image layer.</p> <p>A container is a snapshot of the image it is created from. The diagram below shows two containers - one based on the Ubuntu image and the other based on the Busybox image.</p> <p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/two_dm_container.jpg" alt=""></p> <h2 id="reads-with-the-devicemapper">Reads with the devicemapper</h2> <p>Let’s look at how reads and writes occur using the <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver. The diagram below shows the high level process for reading a single block (<code>0x44f</code>) in an example container.</p> <p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/dm_container.jpg" alt=""></p> <ol> <li>
<p>An application makes a read request for block <code>0x44f</code> in the container.</p> <p>Because the container is a thin snapshot of an image it does not have the data. Instead, it has a pointer (PTR) to where the data is stored in the image snapshot lower down in the image stack.</p>
</li> <li><p>The storage driver follows the pointer to block <code>0xf33</code> in the snapshot relating to image layer <code>a005...</code>.</p></li> <li><p>The <code>devicemapper</code> copies the contents of block <code>0xf33</code> from the image snapshot to memory in the container.</p></li> <li><p>The storage driver returns the data to the requesting application.</p></li> </ol> <h2 id="write-examples">Write examples</h2> <p>With the <code>devicemapper</code> driver, writing new data to a container is accomplished by an <em>allocate-on-demand</em> operation. Updating existing data uses a copy-on-write operation. Because Device Mapper is a block-based technology these operations occur at the block level.</p> <p>For example, when making a small change to a large file in a container, the <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver does not copy the entire file. It only copies the blocks to be modified. Each block is 64KB.</p> <h3 id="writing-new-data">Writing new data</h3> <p>To write 56KB of new data to a container:</p> <ol> <li><p>An application makes a request to write 56KB of new data to the container.</p></li> <li>
<p>The allocate-on-demand operation allocates a single new 64KB block to the container’s snapshot.</p> <p>If the write operation is larger than 64KB, multiple new blocks are allocated to the container’s snapshot.</p>
</li> <li><p>The data is written to the newly allocated block.</p></li> </ol> <h3 id="overwriting-existing-data">Overwriting existing data</h3> <p>To modify existing data for the first time:</p> <ol> <li><p>An application makes a request to modify some data in the container.</p></li> <li><p>A copy-on-write operation locates the blocks that need updating.</p></li> <li><p>The operation allocates new empty blocks to the container snapshot and copies the data into those blocks.</p></li> <li><p>The modified data is written into the newly allocated blocks.</p></li> </ol> <p>The application in the container is unaware of any of these allocate-on-demand and copy-on-write operations. However, they may add latency to the application’s read and write operations.</p> <h2 id="configure-docker-with-devicemapper">Configure Docker with devicemapper</h2> <p>The <code>devicemapper</code> is the default Docker storage driver on some Linux distributions. This includes RHEL and most of its forks. Currently, the following distributions support the driver:</p> <ul> <li>RHEL/CentOS/Fedora</li> <li>Ubuntu 12.04</li> <li>Ubuntu 14.04</li> <li>Debian</li> </ul> <p>Docker hosts running the <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver default to a configuration mode known as <code>loop-lvm</code>. This mode uses sparse files to build the thin pool used by image and container snapshots. The mode is designed to work out-of-the-box with no additional configuration. However, production deployments should not run under <code>loop-lvm</code> mode.</p> <p>You can detect the mode by viewing the <code>docker info</code> command:</p> <pre>$ sudo docker info
Containers: 0
Images: 0
Storage Driver: devicemapper
 Pool Name: docker-202:2-25220302-pool
 Pool Blocksize: 65.54 kB
 Backing Filesystem: xfs
 [...]
 Data loop file: /var/lib/docker/devicemapper/devicemapper/data
 Metadata loop file: /var/lib/docker/devicemapper/devicemapper/metadata
 Library Version: 1.02.93-RHEL7 (2015-01-28)
 [...]
</pre> <p>The output above shows a Docker host running with the <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver operating in <code>loop-lvm</code> mode. This is indicated by the fact that the <code>Data loop file</code> and a <code>Metadata loop file</code> are on files under <code>/var/lib/docker/devicemapper/devicemapper</code>. These are loopback mounted sparse files.</p> <h3 id="configure-direct-lvm-mode-for-production">Configure direct-lvm mode for production</h3> <p>The preferred configuration for production deployments is <code>direct-lvm</code>. This mode uses block devices to create the thin pool. The following procedure shows you how to configure a Docker host to use the <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver in a <code>direct-lvm</code> configuration.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Caution:</strong> If you have already run the Docker daemon on your Docker host and have images you want to keep, <code>push</code> them Docker Hub or your private Docker Trusted Registry before attempting this procedure.</p> </blockquote> <p>The procedure below will create a logical volume configured as a thin pool to use as backing for the storage pool. It assumes that you have a spare block device at <code>/dev/xvdf</code> with enough free space to complete the task. The device identifier and volume sizes may be be different in your environment and you should substitute your own values throughout the procedure. The procedure also assumes that the Docker daemon is in the <code>stopped</code> state.</p> <ol> <li><p>Log in to the Docker host you want to configure and stop the Docker daemon.</p></li> <li><p>Install the LVM2 package. The LVM2 package includes the userspace toolset that provides logical volume management facilities on linux.</p></li> <li>
<p>Create a physical volume replacing <code>/dev/xvdf</code> with your block device.</p> <pre>$ pvcreate /dev/xvdf
</pre>
</li> <li>
<p>Create a ‘docker’ volume group.</p> <pre>$ vgcreate docker /dev/xvdf
</pre>
</li> <li>
<p>Create a thin pool named <code>thinpool</code>.</p> <p>In this example, the data logical is 95% of the ‘docker’ volume group size. Leaving this free space allows for auto expanding of either the data or metadata if space runs low as a temporary stopgap.</p> <pre>$ lvcreate --wipesignatures y -n thinpool docker -l 95%VG
$ lvcreate --wipesignatures y -n thinpoolmeta docker -l 1%VG
</pre>
</li> <li>
<p>Convert the pool to a thin pool.</p> <pre>$ lvconvert -y --zero n -c 512K --thinpool docker/thinpool --poolmetadata docker/thinpoolmeta
</pre>
</li> <li>
<p>Configure autoextension of thin pools via an <code>lvm</code> profile.</p> <pre>$ vi /etc/lvm/profile/docker-thinpool.profile
</pre>
</li> <li>
<p>Specify ‘thin_pool_autoextend_threshold’ value.</p> <p>The value should be the percentage of space used before <code>lvm</code> attempts to autoextend the available space (100 = disabled).</p> <pre>thin_pool_autoextend_threshold = 80
</pre>
</li> <li>
<p>Modify the <code>thin_pool_autoextend_percent</code> for when thin pool autoextension occurs.</p> <p>The value’s setting is the perentage of space to increase the thin pool (100 = disabled)</p> <pre>thin_pool_autoextend_percent = 20
</pre>
</li> <li>
<p>Check your work, your <code>docker-thinpool.profile</code> file should appear similar to the following:</p> <p>An example <code>/etc/lvm/profile/docker-thinpool.profile</code> file:</p> <pre>activation {
    thin_pool_autoextend_threshold=80
    thin_pool_autoextend_percent=20
}
</pre>
</li> <li>
<p>Apply your new lvm profile</p> <pre>$ lvchange --metadataprofile docker-thinpool docker/thinpool
</pre>
</li> <li>
<p>Verify the <code>lv</code> is monitored.</p> <pre>$ lvs -o+seg_monitor
</pre>
</li> <li>
<p>If the Docker daemon was previously started, clear your graph driver directory.</p> <p>Clearing your graph driver removes any images, containers, and volumes in your Docker installation.</p> <pre>$ rm -rf /var/lib/docker/*
</pre>
</li> <li>
<p>Configure the Docker daemon with specific devicemapper options.</p> <p>There are two ways to do this. You can set options on the commmand line if you start the daemon there:</p> <pre>--storage-driver=devicemapper --storage-opt=dm.thinpooldev=/dev/mapper/docker-thinpool --storage-opt dm.use_deferred_removal=true
</pre> <p>You can also set them for startup in the <code>daemon.json</code> configuration, for example:</p> <pre> {
     "storage-driver": "devicemapper",
     "storage-opts": [
         "dm.thinpooldev=/dev/mapper/docker-thinpool",
         "dm.use_deferred_removal=true"
     ]
 }
</pre>
</li> <li>
<p>If using systemd and modifying the daemon configuration via unit or drop-in file, reload systemd to scan for changes.</p> <pre>$ systemctl daemon-reload
</pre>
</li> <li>
<p>Start the Docker daemon.</p> <pre>$ systemctl start docker
</pre>
</li> </ol> <p>After you start the Docker daemon, ensure you monitor your thin pool and volume group free space. While the volume group will auto-extend, it can still fill up. To monitor logical volumes, use <code>lvs</code> without options or <code>lvs -a</code> to see tha data and metadata sizes. To monitor volume group free space, use the <code>vgs</code> command.</p> <p>Logs can show the auto-extension of the thin pool when it hits the threshold, to view the logs use:</p> <pre>$ journalctl -fu dm-event.service
</pre> <p>If you run into repeated problems with thin pool, you can use the <code>dm.min_free_space</code> option to tune the Engine behavior. This value ensures that operations fail with a warning when the free space is at or near the minimum. For information, see <a href="../../../reference/commandline/daemon/#storage-driver-options" target="_blank">the storage driver options in the Engine daemon reference</a>.</p> <h3 id="examine-devicemapper-structures-on-the-host">Examine devicemapper structures on the host</h3> <p>You can use the <code>lsblk</code> command to see the device files created above and the <code>pool</code> that the <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver creates on top of them.</p> <pre>$ sudo lsblk

</pre> <p>The diagram below shows the image from prior examples updated with the detail from the <code>lsblk</code> command above.</p> <p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/lsblk-diagram.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>In the diagram, the pool is named <code>Docker-202:1-1032-pool</code> and spans the <code>data</code> and <code>metadata</code> devices created earlier. The <code>devicemapper</code> constructs the pool name as follows:</p> <pre>Docker-MAJ:MIN-INO-pool
</pre> <p><code>MAJ</code>, <code>MIN</code> and <code>INO</code> refer to the major and minor device numbers and inode.</p> <p>Because Device Mapper operates at the block level it is more difficult to see diffs between image layers and containers. Docker 1.10 and later no longer matches image layer IDs with directory names in <code>/var/lib/docker</code>. However, there are two key directories. The <code>/var/lib/docker/devicemapper/mnt</code> directory contains the mount points for image and container layers. The <code>/var/lib/docker/devicemapper/metadata</code>directory contains one file for every image layer and container snapshot. The files contain metadata about each snapshot in JSON format.</p> <h2 id="increase-capacity-on-a-running-device">Increase capacity on a running device</h2> <p>You can increase the capacity of the pool on a running thin-pool device. This is useful if the data’s logical volume is full and the volume group is at full capacity.</p> <h3 id="for-a-loop-lvm-configuration">For a loop-lvm configuration</h3> <p>In this scenario, the thin pool is configured to use <code>loop-lvm</code> mode.

A write that uses less than 64KB still results in a single 64KB block being allocated. Writing more than 64KB of data uses multiple 64KB blocks. This can impact container performance, especially in containers that perform lots of small writes. However, once a block is allocated to a container subsequent reads and writes can operate directly on that block.</p> <h3 id="copy-on-write-performance-impact">Copy-on-write performance impact</h3> <p>Each time a container updates existing data for the first time, the <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver has to perform a copy-on-write operation. This copies the data from the image snapshot to the container’s snapshot. This process can have a noticeable impact on container performance.</p> <p>All copy-on-write operations have a 64KB granularity. As a results, updating 32KB of a 1GB file causes the driver to copy a single 64KB block into the container’s snapshot. This has obvious performance advantages over file-level copy-on-write operations which would require copying the entire 1GB file into the container layer.</p> <p>In practice, however, containers that perform lots of small block writes (&lt;64KB) can perform worse with <code>devicemapper</code> than with AUFS.</p> <h3 id="other-device-mapper-performance-considerations">Other device mapper performance considerations</h3> <p>There are several other things that impact the performance of the <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The mode.</strong> The default mode for Docker running the <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver is <code>loop-lvm</code>. This mode uses sparse files and suffers from poor performance. It is <strong>not recommended for production</strong>. The recommended mode for production environments is <code>direct-lvm</code> where the storage driver writes directly to raw block devices.</p></li> <li><p><strong>High speed storage.</strong> For best performance you should place the <code>Data file</code> and <code>Metadata file</code> on high speed storage such as SSD. This can be direct attached storage or from a SAN or NAS array.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Memory usage.</strong> <code>devicemapper</code> is not the most memory efficient Docker storage driver. Launching <em>n</em> copies of the same container loads <em>n</em> copies of its files into memory. This can have a memory impact on your Docker host. As a result, the <code>devicemapper</code> storage driver may not be the best choice for PaaS and other high density use cases.</p></li> </ul> <p>One final point, data volumes provide the best and most predictable performance. This is because they bypass the storage driver and do not incur any of the potential overheads introduced by thin provisioning and copy-on-write. For this reason, you should to place heavy write workloads on data volumes.</p> <h2 id="related-information">Related Information</h2> <ul> <li><a href="../imagesandcontainers/">Understand images, containers, and storage drivers</a></li> <li><a href="../selectadriver/">Select a storage driver</a></li> <li><a href="../aufs-driver/">AUFS storage driver in practice</a></li> <li><a href="../btrfs-driver/">Btrfs storage driver in practice</a></li> <li><a href="../../../reference/commandline/daemon/#storage-driver-options">daemon reference</a></li> </ul>
