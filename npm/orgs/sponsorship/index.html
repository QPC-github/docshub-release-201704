<h1 id="sponsorship">Sponsorship</h1> <h2 id="sponsorship-types">Sponsorship Types</h2> <p><img src="https://docs.npmjs.com/images/orgs/ships-dashboard.png" alt="org-sponsorship levels"></p> <p>Let's say we have an Organization, <code>@ag_org</code>. This Organization was created by user <code>@ag_dubs</code>, and therefore she is the <a href="../roles/#Super-Admin"><code>Super Admin</code></a>.</p> <p><img src="https://docs.npmjs.com/images/orgs/ships-superadmin.png" alt="super admin"></p> <p>Being a Super Admin, she adds 3 members to her team:</p> <ul> <li>Jacques Derrida</li> <li>Carl Sagan</li> <li>Emma Goldman</li> </ul> <p>There are three types of Sponsorship that can occur:</p> <ul> <li>Paid by Current Organization</li> <li>Paid by Self or Another Organization</li> <li>Not Paid</li> </ul> <h3 id="paid-by-current-organization">Paid by Current Organization</h3> <p>When Super Admin, <code>@ag_dubs</code>, added <code>JacquesDerrida</code> to the Organization, <code>JacquesDerrida</code> did not already belong to an organization nor did they have a subscription to private packages.</p> <p>By default, when the Super Admin added him to the Organization, <code>JacquesDerrida</code> was set as a member of the Organization, <strong>paid by the current organization</strong>. This appears in the UI like this:</p> <p><img src="https://docs.npmjs.com/images/orgs/ships-paidcurrent.png" alt="paid by current org"></p> <ul> <li>Because <code>JacquesDerrida</code> is a <code>developer</code> in the org, they can: <ul> <li>Be added to any/all of the Organization's teams,</li> <li>See the teams they are on,</li> <li>See the other members of the team,</li> <li>
<em>See</em> the packages (both public and private) those teams grant access to,</li> </ul> </li> <li>Because <code>JacquesDerrida</code> is sponsored, they can: <ul> <li>Install, publish, and unpublish the private packages to which they have access</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><code>JacquesDerrida</code> cannot:</p> <ul> <li>See all of the Organization's teams</li> <li>See all members of the Organization</li> </ul> <h3 id="paid-by-self-or-another-organization">Paid by Self or Another Organization</h3> <ul> <li> <p>#### Paid for by Another Organization</p> <p>When Super Admin, <code>@ag_dubs</code>, added <code>CarlSagan</code> to the Organization, <code>CarlSagan</code> already belonged to another Organization (<code>@nasa-org</code>, duh).</p> <p>By default, when <code>CarlSagan</code> was added to the Organization, he was set as a member of the Organization, <strong>paid by another scope</strong>. This appears in the UI like this:</p> <p><img src="https://docs.npmjs.com/images/orgs/ships-paidother.png" alt="paid, but not by the org"></p> <p>As a result, <code>CarlSagan</code> has the same permissions as <code>JacquesDerrida</code>, above.</p> <ul> <li> <p>#### Paid for by Self</p> <p>As a subscriber to Private Packages, you can understand your sponsorship as "sponsoring yourself". As a result, a subscriber to private packages would have had the same default behavior as occured for <code>CarlSagan</code>, i.e., the previous sponsorship would trump the possibility of a new Organization sponsorship. A subscriber to private packages will appear in the Organization dashboard as someone who is <code>paid</code> but <code>not by the current org</code>. This appears in the UI the same as above:</p> <p><img src="https://docs.npmjs.com/images/orgs/ships-paidother.png" alt="paid, but not by the org"></p> </li> <li> <p>#### Changing Sponsorship</p> <p>If a user is a subscriber to private packages, this sponsorship scope will trump all other potential sponsorships. If you would like to change this, i.e., offer sponsorship to a user who already has another sponsorship (org or private pkgs), please contact <a href="../mailto:support@npmjs.com/">support@npmjs.com</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>### Not Paid</p> <p><code>EmmaGoldman</code>, at the time that <code>@ag_dubs</code> added them to the <code>@ag_org</code> Organization, did not subscribe to private packages nor did they belong to another Organization. This means that they did not have any previous sponsorships.</p> <p>Like <code>JacquesDerrida</code>, <code>EmmaGoldman</code> was set as <strong>paid by the current organization, <code>@ag-org</code></strong> by default. However, Super Admin <code>@ag_dubs</code> opted to cancel <code>@ag-org</code>'s sponsorship of <code>EmmaGoldman</code>. This status appears in the UI like this:</p> <p><img src="https://docs.npmjs.com/images/orgs/ships-notpaid.png" alt="not paid"></p> <ul> <li>Because <code>EmmaGoldman</code> is a <code>developer</code> in the org, they can: <ul> <li>Be added to any/all of the Organization's teams,</li> <li>See the teams they are on,</li> <li>See the other members of the team,</li> <li>
<em>See</em> the packages (both public and private) those teams grant access to,</li> </ul> </li> <li>Because <code>EmmaGoldman</code> is <em>not</em> sponsored, they <em>cannot</em>: <ul> <li>Install, publish, and unpublish the private packages to which they have access</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><code>EmmaGoldman</code> can:</p> <ul> <li>Collaborate on and publish public, scoped or unscoped packages, that their team membership grants them access to</li> </ul> <p><code>EmmaGoldman</code> cannot:</p> <ul> <li>See all of the Organization's teams</li> <li>See all members of the Organization</li> <li>Collaborate on and publish any private packages, even if their team membership would otherwise grant them access</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
