</pre> </div> <div class="REFSECT1" id="SQL-GRANT-DESCRIPTION">  <h2>Description</h2> <p>The <code class="COMMAND">GRANT</code> command has two basic variants: one that grants privileges on a database object (table, column, view, foreign table, sequence, database, foreign-data wrapper, foreign server, function, procedural language, schema, or tablespace), and one that grants membership in a role. These variants are similar in many ways, but they are different enough to be described separately.</p> <div class="REFSECT2" id="SQL-GRANT-DESCRIPTION-OBJECTS">  <h3>GRANT on Database Objects</h3> <p>This variant of the <code class="COMMAND">GRANT</code> command gives specific privileges on a database object to one or more roles. These privileges are added to those already granted, if any.</p> <p>There is also an option to grant privileges on all objects of the same type within one or more schemas. This functionality is currently supported only for tables, sequences, and functions (but note that <code class="LITERAL">ALL TABLES</code> is considered to include views and foreign tables).</p> <p>The key word <code class="LITERAL">PUBLIC</code> indicates that the privileges are to be granted to all roles, including those that might be created later. <code class="LITERAL">PUBLIC</code> can be thought of as an implicitly defined group that always includes all roles. Any particular role will have the sum of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted to any role it is presently a member of, and privileges granted to <code class="LITERAL">PUBLIC</code>.</p> <p>If <code class="LITERAL">WITH GRANT OPTION</code> is specified, the recipient of the privilege can in turn grant it to others. Without a grant option, the recipient cannot do that. Grant options cannot be granted to <code class="LITERAL">PUBLIC</code>.</p> <p>There is no need to grant privileges to the owner of an object (usually the user that created it), as the owner has all privileges by default. (The owner could, however, choose to revoke some of his own privileges for safety.)</p> <p>The right to drop an object, or to alter its definition in any way, is not treated as a grantable privilege; it is inherent in the owner, and cannot be granted or revoked. (However, a similar effect can be obtained by granting or revoking membership in the role that owns the object; see below.) The owner implicitly has all grant options for the object, too.</p> <p>PostgreSQL grants default privileges on some types of objects to <code class="LITERAL">PUBLIC</code>. No privileges are granted to <code class="LITERAL">PUBLIC</code> by default on tables, columns, schemas or tablespaces. For other types, the default privileges granted to <code class="LITERAL">PUBLIC</code> are as follows: <code class="LITERAL">CONNECT</code> and <code class="LITERAL">CREATE TEMP TABLE</code> for databases; <code class="LITERAL">EXECUTE</code> privilege for functions; and <code class="LITERAL">USAGE</code> privilege for languages. The object owner can, of course, <code class="COMMAND">REVOKE</code> both default and expressly granted privileges. (For maximum security, issue the <code class="COMMAND">REVOKE</code> in the same transaction that creates the object; then there is no window in which another user can use the object.) Also, these initial default privilege settings can be changed using the <a href="../sql-alterdefaultprivileges/">ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES</a> command.</p> <p>The possible privileges are:</p> <div class="VARIABLELIST"> <dl> <dt>SELECT</dt> <dd> <p>Allows <a href="../sql-select/">SELECT</a> from any column, or the specific columns listed, of the specified table, view, or sequence. Also allows the use of <a href="../sql-copy/">COPY</a> TO. This privilege is also needed to reference existing column values in <a href="../sql-update/">UPDATE</a> or <a href="../sql-delete/">DELETE</a>. For sequences, this privilege also allows the use of the <code class="FUNCTION">currval</code> function. For large objects, this privilege allows the object to be read.</p> </dd> <dt>INSERT</dt> <dd> <p>Allows <a href="../sql-insert/">INSERT</a> of a new row into the specified table. If specific columns are listed, only those columns may be assigned to in the <code class="COMMAND">INSERT</code> command (other columns will therefore receive default values). Also allows <a href="../sql-copy/">COPY</a> FROM.</p> </dd> <dt>UPDATE</dt> <dd> <p>Allows <a href="../sql-update/">UPDATE</a> of any column, or the specific columns listed, of the specified table. (In practice, any nontrivial <code class="COMMAND">UPDATE</code> command will require <code class="LITERAL">SELECT</code> privilege as well, since it must reference table columns to determine which rows to update, and/or to compute new values for columns.) <code class="LITERAL">SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</code> and <code class="LITERAL">SELECT ... FOR SHARE</code> also require this privilege on at least one column, in addition to the <code class="LITERAL">SELECT</code> privilege. For sequences, this privilege allows the use of the <code class="FUNCTION">nextval</code> and <code class="FUNCTION">setval</code> functions. For large objects, this privilege allows writing or truncating the object.</p> </dd> <dt>DELETE</dt> <dd> <p>Allows <a href="../sql-delete/">DELETE</a> of a row from the specified table. (In practice, any nontrivial <code class="COMMAND">DELETE</code> command will require <code class="LITERAL">SELECT</code> privilege as well, since it must reference table columns to determine which rows to delete.)</p> </dd> <dt>TRUNCATE</dt> <dd> <p>Allows <a href="../sql-truncate/">TRUNCATE</a> on the specified table.</p> </dd> <dt>REFERENCES</dt> <dd> <p>To create a foreign key constraint, it is necessary to have this privilege on both the referencing and referenced columns. The privilege may be granted for all columns of a table, or just specific columns.</p> </dd> <dt>TRIGGER</dt> <dd> <p>Allows the creation of a trigger on the specified table. (See the <a href="../sql-createtrigger/">CREATE TRIGGER</a> statement.)</p> </dd> <dt>CREATE</dt> <dd> <p>For databases, allows new schemas to be created within the database.</p> <p>For schemas, allows new objects to be created within the schema. To rename an existing object, you must own the object <span class="emphasis EMPHASIS c3">and</span> have this privilege for the containing schema.</p> <p>For tablespaces, allows tables, indexes, and temporary files to be created within the tablespace, and allows databases to be created that have the tablespace as their default tablespace. (Note that revoking this privilege will not alter the placement of existing objects.)</p> </dd> <dt>CONNECT</dt> <dd> <p>Allows the user to connect to the specified database. This privilege is checked at connection startup (in addition to checking any restrictions imposed by <code class="FILENAME">pg_hba.conf</code>).</p> </dd> <dt>TEMPORARY<br> TEMP</dt> <dd> <p>Allows temporary tables to be created while using the specified database.</p> </dd> <dt>EXECUTE</dt> <dd> <p>Allows the use of the specified function and the use of any operators that are implemented on top of the function. This is the only type of privilege that is applicable to functions. (This syntax works for aggregate functions, as well.)</p> </dd> <dt>USAGE</dt> <dd> <p>For procedural languages, allows the use of the specified language for the creation of functions in that language. This is the only type of privilege that is applicable to procedural languages.</p> <p>For schemas, allows access to objects contained in the specified schema (assuming that the objects' own privilege requirements are also met). Essentially this allows the grantee to <span class="QUOTE">"look up"</span> objects within the schema. Without this permission, it is still possible to see the object names, e.g. by querying the system tables. Also, after revoking this permission, existing backends might have statements that have previously performed this lookup, so this is not a completely secure way to prevent object access.</p> <p>For sequences, this privilege allows the use of the <code class="FUNCTION">currval</code> and <code class="FUNCTION">nextval</code> functions.</p> <p>For types and domains, this privilege allow the use of the type or domain in the creation of tables, functions, and other schema objects. (Note that it does not control general <span class="QUOTE">"usage"</span> of the type, such as values of the type appearing in queries. It only prevents objects from being created that depend on the type. The main purpose of the privilege is controlling which users create dependencies on a type, which could prevent the owner from changing the type later.)</p> <p>For foreign-data wrappers, this privilege enables the grantee to create new servers using that foreign-data wrapper.</p> <p>For servers, this privilege enables the grantee to create foreign tables using the server, and also to create, alter, or drop his own user's user mappings associated with that server.</p> </dd> <dt>ALL PRIVILEGES</dt> <dd> <p>Grant all of the available privileges at once. The <code class="LITERAL">PRIVILEGES</code> key word is optional in <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span>, though it is required by strict SQL.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>The privileges required by other commands are listed on the reference page of the respective command.</p> </div> <div class="REFSECT2" id="SQL-GRANT-DESCRIPTION-ROLES">  <h3>GRANT on Roles</h3> <p>This variant of the <code class="COMMAND">GRANT</code> command grants membership in a role to one or more other roles. Membership in a role is significant because it conveys the privileges granted to a role to each of its members.</p> <p>If <code class="LITERAL">WITH ADMIN OPTION</code> is specified, the member can in turn grant membership in the role to others, and revoke membership in the role as well. Without the admin option, ordinary users cannot do that. A role is not considered to hold <code class="LITERAL">WITH ADMIN OPTION</code> on itself, but it may grant or revoke membership in itself from a database session where the session user matches the role. Database superusers can grant or revoke membership in any role to anyone. Roles having <code class="LITERAL">CREATEROLE</code> privilege can grant or revoke membership in any role that is not a superuser.</p> <p>Unlike the case with privileges, membership in a role cannot be granted to <code class="LITERAL">PUBLIC</code>. Note also that this form of the command does not allow the noise word <code class="LITERAL">GROUP</code>.</p> </div> </div> <div class="REFSECT1" id="SQL-GRANT-NOTES">  <h2>Notes</h2> <p>The <a href="../sql-revoke/">REVOKE</a> command is used to revoke access privileges.</p> <p>Since <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> 8.1, the concepts of users and groups have been unified into a single kind of entity called a role. It is therefore no longer necessary to use the keyword <code class="LITERAL">GROUP</code> to identify whether a grantee is a user or a group. <code class="LITERAL">GROUP</code> is still allowed in the command, but it is a noise word.</p> <p>A user may perform <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code>, <code class="COMMAND">INSERT</code>, etc. on a column if he holds that privilege for either the specific column or its whole table. Granting the privilege at the table level and then revoking it for one column will not do what you might wish: the table-level grant is unaffected by a column-level operation.</p> <p>When a non-owner of an object attempts to <code class="COMMAND">GRANT</code> privileges on the object, the command will fail outright if the user has no privileges whatsoever on the object. As long as some privilege is available, the command will proceed, but it will grant only those privileges for which the user has grant options. The <code class="COMMAND">GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES</code> forms will issue a warning message if no grant options are held, while the other forms will issue a warning if grant options for any of the privileges specifically named in the command are not held. (In principle these statements apply to the object owner as well, but since the owner is always treated as holding all grant options, the cases can never occur.)</p> <p>It should be noted that database superusers can access all objects regardless of object privilege settings. This is comparable to the rights of <code class="LITERAL">root</code> in a Unix system. As with <code class="LITERAL">root</code>, it's unwise to operate as a superuser except when absolutely necessary.</p> <p>If a superuser chooses to issue a <code class="COMMAND">GRANT</code> or <code class="COMMAND">REVOKE</code> command, the command is performed as though it were issued by the owner of the affected object. In particular, privileges granted via such a command will appear to have been granted by the object owner. (For role membership, the membership appears to have been granted by the containing role itself.)</p> <p><code class="COMMAND">GRANT</code> and <code class="COMMAND">REVOKE</code> can also be done by a role that is not the owner of the affected object, but is a member of the role that owns the object, or is a member of a role that holds privileges <code class="LITERAL">WITH GRANT OPTION</code> on the object. In this case the privileges will be recorded as having been granted by the role that actually owns the object or holds the privileges <code class="LITERAL">WITH GRANT OPTION</code>. For example, if table <code class="LITERAL">t1</code> is owned by role <code class="LITERAL">g1</code>, of which role <code class="LITERAL">u1</code> is a member, then <code class="LITERAL">u1</code> can grant privileges on <code class="LITERAL">t1</code> to <code class="LITERAL">u2</code>, but those privileges will appear to have been granted directly by <code class="LITERAL">g1</code>. Any other member of role <code class="LITERAL">g1</code> could revoke them later.</p> <p>If the role executing <code class="COMMAND">GRANT</code> holds the required privileges indirectly via more than one role membership path, it is unspecified which containing role will be recorded as having done the grant. In such cases it is best practice to use <code class="COMMAND">SET ROLE</code> to become the specific role you want to do the <code class="COMMAND">GRANT</code> as.</p> <p>Granting permission on a table does not automatically extend permissions to any sequences used by the table, including sequences tied to <code class="TYPE">SERIAL</code> columns. Permissions on sequences must be set separately.</p> <p>Use <a href="../app-psql/"><span class="APPLICATION">psql</span></a>'s <code class="COMMAND">\dp</code> command to obtain information about existing privileges for tables and columns. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
=&gt; \dp mytable
                              Access privileges
 Schema |  Name   | Type  |   Access privileges   | Column access privileges

                          : =r/miriam             :   miriam_rw=rw/miriam
                          : admin=arw/miriam        
(1 row)
</pre> <p>The entries shown by <code class="COMMAND">\dp</code> are interpreted thus:</p> <pre class="LITERALLAYOUT">
rolename=xxxx -- privileges granted to a role
        =xxxx -- privileges granted to PUBLIC

            r -- SELECT ("read")
            w -- UPDATE ("write")
            a -- INSERT ("append")
            d -- DELETE
            D -- TRUNCATE
            x -- REFERENCES
            t -- TRIGGER
            X -- EXECUTE
            U -- USAGE
            C -- CREATE
            c -- CONNECT
            T -- TEMPORARY
      arwdDxt -- ALL PRIVILEGES (for tables, varies for other objects)
            * -- grant option for preceding privilege

        /yyyy -- role that granted this privilege
</pre> <p>The above example display would be seen by user <code class="LITERAL">miriam</code> after creating table <code class="LITERAL">mytable</code> and doing:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
GRANT SELECT ON mytable TO PUBLIC;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT ON mytable TO admin;
GRANT SELECT (col1), UPDATE (col1) ON mytable TO miriam_rw;
</pre> <p>For non-table objects there are other <code class="COMMAND">\d</code> commands that can display their privileges.</p> <p>If the <span class="QUOTE">"Access privileges"</span> column is empty for a given object, it means the object has default privileges (that is, its privileges column is null). Default privileges always include all privileges for the owner, and can include some privileges for <code class="LITERAL">PUBLIC</code> depending on the object type, as explained above. The first <code class="COMMAND">GRANT</code> or <code class="COMMAND">REVOKE</code> on an object will instantiate the default privileges (producing, for example, <code class="LITERAL">{miriam=arwdDxt/miriam}</code>) and then modify them per the specified request. Similarly, entries are shown in <span class="QUOTE">"Column access privileges"</span> only for columns with nondefault privileges. (Note: for this purpose, <span class="QUOTE">"default privileges"</span> always means the built-in default privileges for the object's type. An object whose privileges have been affected by an <code class="COMMAND">ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES</code> command will always be shown with an explicit privilege entry that includes the effects of the <code class="COMMAND">ALTER</code>.)</p> <p>Notice that the owner's implicit grant options are not marked in the access privileges display. A <code class="LITERAL">*</code> will appear only when grant options have been explicitly granted to someone.</p> </div> <div class="REFSECT1" id="SQL-GRANT-EXAMPLES">  <h2>Examples</h2> <p>Grant insert privilege to all users on table <code class="LITERAL">films</code>:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">

</pre> </div> <div class="REFSECT1" id="SQL-GRANT-COMPATIBILITY">  <h2>Compatibility</h2> <p>According to the SQL standard, the <code class="LITERAL">PRIVILEGES</code> key word in <code class="LITERAL">ALL PRIVILEGES</code> is required. The SQL standard does not support setting the privileges on more than one object per command.</p> <p><span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> allows an object owner to revoke his own ordinary privileges: for example, a table owner can make the table read-only to himself by revoking his own <code class="LITERAL">INSERT</code>, <code class="LITERAL">UPDATE</code>, <code class="LITERAL">DELETE</code>, and <code class="LITERAL">TRUNCATE</code> privileges. This is not possible according to the SQL standard. The reason is that <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> treats the owner's privileges as having been granted by the owner to himself; therefore he can revoke them too.
