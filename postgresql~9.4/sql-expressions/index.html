<h1 class="SECT1" id="SQL-EXPRESSIONS">4.2. Value Expressions</h1> <p>Value expressions are used in a variety of contexts, such as in the target list of the <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code> command, as new column values in <code class="COMMAND">INSERT</code> or <code class="COMMAND">UPDATE</code>, or in search conditions in a number of commands. The result of a value expression is sometimes called a <i class="FIRSTTERM">scalar</i>, to distinguish it from the result of a table expression (which is a table). Value expressions are therefore also called <i class="FIRSTTERM">scalar expressions</i> (or even simply <i class="FIRSTTERM">expressions</i>). The expression syntax allows the calculation of values from primitive parts using arithmetic, logical, set, and other operations.</p> <p>A value expression is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A constant or literal value</p> </li> <li> <p>A column reference</p> </li> <li> <p>A positional parameter reference, in the body of a function definition or prepared statement</p> </li> <li> <p>A subscripted expression</p> </li> <li> <p>A field selection expression</p> </li> <li> <p>An operator invocation</p> </li> <li> <p>A function call</p> </li> <li> <p>An aggregate expression</p> </li> <li> <p>A window function call</p> </li> <li> <p>A type cast</p> </li> <li> <p>A collation expression</p> </li> <li> <p>A scalar subquery</p> </li> <li> <p>An array constructor</p> </li> <li> <p>A row constructor</p> </li> <li> <p>Another value expression in parentheses (used to group subexpressions and override precedence)</p> </li> </ul> <p>In addition to this list, there are a number of constructs that can be classified as an expression but do not follow any general syntax rules. These generally have the semantics of a function or operator and are explained in the appropriate location in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions.html" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>. An example is the <code class="LITERAL">IS NULL</code> clause.</p> <p>We have already discussed constants in <a href="../sql-syntax-lexical/#SQL-SYNTAX-CONSTANTS">Section 4.1.2</a>. The following sections discuss the remaining options.</p> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="SQL-EXPRESSIONS-COLUMN-REFS">4.2.1. Column References</h2> <p>A column can be referenced in the form:</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
correlation.columnname
</pre> <p><code class="REPLACEABLE c2">correlation</code> is the name of a table (possibly qualified with a schema name), or an alias for a table defined by means of a <code class="LITERAL">FROM</code> clause. The correlation name and separating dot can be omitted if the column name is unique across all the tables being used in the current query. (See also <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/queries.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>.)</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="SQL-EXPRESSIONS-PARAMETERS-POSITIONAL">4.2.2. Positional Parameters</h2> <p>A positional parameter reference is used to indicate a value that is supplied externally to an SQL statement. Parameters are used in SQL function definitions and in prepared queries. Some client libraries also support specifying data values separately from the SQL command string, in which case parameters are used to refer to the out-of-line data values. The form of a parameter reference is:</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
$number
</pre> <p>For example, consider the definition of a function, <code class="FUNCTION">dept</code>, as:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
CREATE FUNCTION dept(text) RETURNS dept
    AS $$ SELECT * FROM dept WHERE name = $1 $$
    LANGUAGE SQL;
</pre> <p>Here the <code class="LITERAL">$1</code> references the value of the first function argument whenever the function is invoked.</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="SQL-EXPRESSIONS-SUBSCRIPTS">4.2.3. Subscripts</h2> <p>If an expression yields a value of an array type, then a specific element of the array value can be extracted by writing</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
expression[subscript]
</pre> <p>or multiple adjacent elements (an <span class="QUOTE">"array slice"</span>) can be extracted by writing</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
expression[lower_subscript:upper_subscript]
</pre> <p>(Here, the brackets <code class="LITERAL">[ ]</code> are meant to appear literally.) Each <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">subscript</code> is itself an expression, which must yield an integer value.</p> <p>In general the array <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">expression</code> must be parenthesized, but the parentheses can be omitted when the expression to be subscripted is just a column reference or positional parameter. Also, multiple subscripts can be concatenated when the original array is multidimensional. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
mytable.arraycolumn[4]
mytable.two_d_column[17][34]
$1[10:42]
(arrayfunction(a,b))[42]
</pre> <p>The parentheses in the last example are required. See <a href="../arrays/">Section 8.15</a> for more about arrays.</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="FIELD-SELECTION">4.2.4. Field Selection</h2> <p>If an expression yields a value of a composite type (row type), then a specific field of the row can be extracted by writing</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
expression.fieldname
</pre> <p>In general the row <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">expression</code> must be parenthesized, but the parentheses can be omitted when the expression to be selected from is just a table reference or positional parameter. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
mytable.mycolumn
$1.somecolumn
(rowfunction(a,b)).col3
</pre> <p>(Thus, a qualified column reference is actually just a special case of the field selection syntax.) An important special case is extracting a field from a table column that is of a composite type:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
(compositecol).somefield
(mytable.compositecol).somefield
</pre> <p>The parentheses are required here to show that <code class="STRUCTFIELD">compositecol</code> is a column name not a table name, or that <code class="STRUCTNAME">mytable</code> is a table name not a schema name in the second case.</p> <p>You can ask for all fields of a composite value by writing <code class="LITERAL">.*</code>:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
(compositecol).*
</pre> <p>This notation behaves differently depending on context; see <a href="../rowtypes/#ROWTYPES-USAGE">Section 8.16.5</a> for details.</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="SQL-EXPRESSIONS-OPERATOR-CALLS">4.2.5. Operator Invocations</h2> <p>There are three possible syntaxes for an operator invocation:</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>
<code class="REPLACEABLE c2">expression</code> <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">operator</code> <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">expression</code> (binary infix operator)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>
<code class="REPLACEABLE c2">operator</code> <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">expression</code> (unary prefix operator)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>
<code class="REPLACEABLE c2">expression</code> <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">operator</code> (unary postfix operator)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>where the <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">operator</code> token follows the syntax rules of <a href="../sql-syntax-lexical/#SQL-SYNTAX-OPERATORS">Section 4.1.3</a>, or is one of the key words <code class="TOKEN">AND</code>, <code class="TOKEN">OR</code>, and <code class="TOKEN">NOT</code>, or is a qualified operator name in the form: <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
OPERATOR(schema.operatorname)
</pre> <p>Which particular operators exist and whether they are unary or binary depends on what operators have been defined by the system or the user. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions.html" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a> describes the built-in operators.</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="SQL-EXPRESSIONS-FUNCTION-CALLS">4.2.6. Function Calls</h2> <p>The syntax for a function call is the name of a function (possibly qualified with a schema name), followed by its argument list enclosed in parentheses:</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
function_name ([expression [, expression ... ]] )
</pre> <p>For example, the following computes the square root of 2:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
sqrt(2)
</pre> <p>The list of built-in functions is in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions.html" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>. Other functions can be added by the user.</p> <p>The arguments can optionally have names attached. See <a href="../sql-syntax-calling-funcs/">Section 4.3</a> for details.</p>  <blockquote class="NOTE"> <p><b>Note:</b> A function that takes a single argument of composite type can optionally be called using field-selection syntax, and conversely field selection can be written in functional style. That is, the notations <code class="LITERAL">col(table)</code> and <code class="LITERAL">table.col</code> are interchangeable. This behavior is not SQL-standard but is provided in <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> because it allows use of functions to emulate <span class="QUOTE">"computed fields"</span>. For more information see <a href="../rowtypes/#ROWTYPES-USAGE">Section 8.16.5</a>.</p> </blockquote>  </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="SYNTAX-AGGREGATES">4.2.7. Aggregate Expressions</h2> <p>An <i class="FIRSTTERM">aggregate expression</i> represents the application of an aggregate function across the rows selected by a query. An aggregate function reduces multiple inputs to a single output value, such as the sum or average of the inputs. The syntax of an aggregate expression is one of the following:</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
aggregate_name (expression [ , ... ] [ order_by_clause ] ) [ FILTER ( WHERE filter_clause ) ]
aggregate_name (ALL expression [ , ... ] [ order_by_clause ] ) [ FILTER ( WHERE filter_clause ) ]
aggregate_name (DISTINCT expression [ , ... ] [ order_by_clause ] ) [ FILTER ( WHERE filter_clause ) ]
aggregate_name ( * ) [ FILTER ( WHERE filter_clause ) ]
aggregate_name ( [ expression [ , ... ] ] ) WITHIN GROUP ( order_by_clause ) [ FILTER ( WHERE filter_clause ) ]
</pre> <p>where <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">aggregate_name</code> is a previously defined aggregate (possibly qualified with a schema name) and <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">expression</code> is any value expression that does not itself contain an aggregate expression or a window function call. The optional <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">order_by_clause</code> and <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">filter_clause</code> are described below.</p> <p>The first form of aggregate expression invokes the aggregate once for each input row. The second form is the same as the first, since <code class="LITERAL">ALL</code> is the default. The third form invokes the aggregate once for each distinct value of the expression (or distinct set of values, for multiple expressions) found in the input rows. The fourth form invokes the aggregate once for each input row; since no particular input value is specified, it is generally only useful for the <code class="FUNCTION">count(*)</code> aggregate function. The last form is used with <i class="FIRSTTERM">ordered-set</i> aggregate functions, which are described below.</p> <p>Most aggregate functions ignore null inputs, so that rows in which one or more of the expression(s) yield null are discarded. This can be assumed to be true, unless otherwise specified, for all built-in aggregates.</p> <p>For example, <code class="LITERAL">count(*)</code> yields the total number of input rows; <code class="LITERAL">count(f1)</code> yields the number of input rows in which <code class="LITERAL">f1</code> is non-null, since <code class="FUNCTION">count</code> ignores nulls; and <code class="LITERAL">count(distinct f1)</code> yields the number of distinct non-null values of <code class="LITERAL">f1</code>.</p> <p>Ordinarily, the input rows are fed to the aggregate function in an unspecified order. In many cases this does not matter; for example, <code class="FUNCTION">min</code> produces the same result no matter what order it receives the inputs in. However, some aggregate functions (such as <code class="FUNCTION">array_agg</code> and <code class="FUNCTION">string_agg</code>) produce results that depend on the ordering of the input rows. When using such an aggregate, the optional <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">order_by_clause</code> can be used to specify the desired ordering. The <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">order_by_clause</code> has the same syntax as for a query-level <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> clause, as described in <a href="../queries-order/">Section 7.5</a>, except that its expressions are always just expressions and cannot be output-column names or numbers. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT array_agg(a ORDER BY b DESC) FROM table;
</pre> <p>When dealing with multiple-argument aggregate functions, note that the <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> clause goes after all the aggregate arguments. For example, write this:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT string_agg(a, ',' ORDER BY a) FROM table;
</pre> <p>not this:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT string_agg(a ORDER BY a, ',') FROM table;  -- incorrect
</pre> <p>The latter is syntactically valid, but it represents a call of a single-argument aggregate function with two <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> keys (the second one being rather useless since it's a constant).</p> <p>If <code class="LITERAL">DISTINCT</code> is specified in addition to an <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">order_by_clause</code>, then all the <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> expressions must match regular arguments of the aggregate; that is, you cannot sort on an expression that is not included in the <code class="LITERAL">DISTINCT</code> list.</p>  <blockquote class="NOTE"> <p><b>Note:</b> The ability to specify both <code class="LITERAL">DISTINCT</code> and <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> in an aggregate function is a <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> extension.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Placing <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> within the aggregate's regular argument list, as described so far, is used when ordering the input rows for a <span class="QUOTE">"normal"</span> aggregate for which ordering is optional. There is a subclass of aggregate functions called <i class="FIRSTTERM">ordered-set aggregates</i> for which an <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">order_by_clause</code> is <span class="emphasis EMPHASIS c3">required</span>, usually because the aggregate's computation is only sensible in terms of a specific ordering of its input rows. Typical examples of ordered-set aggregates include rank and percentile calculations. For an ordered-set aggregate, the <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">order_by_clause</code> is written inside <code class="LITERAL">WITHIN GROUP (...)</code>, as shown in the final syntax alternative above. The expressions in the <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">order_by_clause</code> are evaluated once per input row just like normal aggregate arguments, sorted as per the <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">order_by_clause</code>'s requirements, and fed to the aggregate function as input arguments. (This is unlike the case for a non-<code class="LITERAL">WITHIN GROUP</code> <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">order_by_clause</code>, which is not treated as argument(s) to the aggregate function.) The argument expressions preceding <code class="LITERAL">WITHIN GROUP</code>, if any, are called <i class="FIRSTTERM">direct arguments</i> to distinguish them from the <i class="FIRSTTERM">aggregated arguments</i> listed in the <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">order_by_clause</code>. Unlike normal aggregate arguments, direct arguments are evaluated only once per aggregate call, not once per input row. This means that they can contain variables only if those variables are grouped by <code class="LITERAL">GROUP BY</code>; this restriction is the same as if the direct arguments were not inside an aggregate expression at all. Direct arguments are typically used for things like percentile fractions, which only make sense as a single value per aggregation calculation. The direct argument list can be empty; in this case, write just <code class="LITERAL">()</code> not <code class="LITERAL">(*)</code>. (<span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> will actually accept either spelling, but only the first way conforms to the SQL standard.)</p> <p>An example of an ordered-set aggregate call is:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT percentile_cont(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY income) FROM households;
 percentile_cont
-----------------
           50489
</pre> <p>which obtains the 50th percentile, or median, value of the <code class="STRUCTFIELD">income</code> column from table <code class="STRUCTNAME">households</code>. Here, <code class="LITERAL">0.5</code> is a direct argument; it would make no sense for the percentile fraction to be a value varying across rows.</p> <p>If <code class="LITERAL">FILTER</code> is specified, then only the input rows for which the <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">filter_clause</code> evaluates to true are fed to the aggregate function; other rows are discarded. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT
    count(*) AS unfiltered,
    count(*) FILTER (WHERE i &lt; 5) AS filtered
FROM generate_series(1,10) AS s(i);
 unfiltered | filtered
------------+----------
         10 |        4
(1 row)
</pre> <p>The predefined aggregate functions are described in <a href="../functions-aggregate/">Section 9.20</a>. Other aggregate functions can be added by the user.</p> <p>An aggregate expression can only appear in the result list or <code class="LITERAL">HAVING</code> clause of a <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code> command. It is forbidden in other clauses, such as <code class="LITERAL">WHERE</code>, because those clauses are logically evaluated before the results of aggregates are formed.</p> <p>When an aggregate expression appears in a subquery (see <a href="../sql-expressions/#SQL-SYNTAX-SCALAR-SUBQUERIES">Section 4.2.11</a> and <a href="../functions-subquery/">Section 9.22</a>), the aggregate is normally evaluated over the rows of the subquery. But an exception occurs if the aggregate's arguments (and <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">filter_clause</code> if any) contain only outer-level variables: the aggregate then belongs to the nearest such outer level, and is evaluated over the rows of that query. The aggregate expression as a whole is then an outer reference for the subquery it appears in, and acts as a constant over any one evaluation of that subquery. The restriction about appearing only in the result list or <code class="LITERAL">HAVING</code> clause applies with respect to the query level that the aggregate belongs to.</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="SYNTAX-WINDOW-FUNCTIONS">4.2.8. Window Function Calls</h2> <p>A <i class="FIRSTTERM">window function call</i> represents the application of an aggregate-like function over some portion of the rows selected by a query. Unlike regular aggregate function calls, this is not tied to grouping of the selected rows into a single output row — each row remains separate in the query output. However the window function is able to scan all the rows that would be part of the current row's group according to the grouping specification (<code class="LITERAL">PARTITION BY</code> list) of the window function call. The syntax of a window function call is one of the following:</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
function_name ([expression [, expression ... ]]) [ FILTER ( WHERE filter_clause ) ] OVER window_name
function_name ([expression [, expression ... ]]) [ FILTER ( WHERE filter_clause ) ] OVER ( window_definition )
function_name ( * ) [ FILTER ( WHERE filter_clause ) ] OVER window_name
function_name ( * ) [ FILTER ( WHERE filter_clause ) ] OVER ( window_definition )
</pre> <p>where <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">window_definition</code> has the syntax</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
[ existing_window_name ]
[ PARTITION BY expression [, ...] ]
[ ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC | USING operator ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ] [, ...] ]
[ frame_clause ]
</pre> <p>and the optional <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_clause</code> can be one of</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
{ RANGE | ROWS } frame_start
{ RANGE | ROWS } BETWEEN frame_start AND frame_end
</pre> <p>where <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_start</code> and <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_end</code> can be one of</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
value PRECEDING
CURRENT ROW
value FOLLOWING
UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
</pre> <p>Here, <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">expression</code> represents any value expression that does not itself contain window function calls.</p> <p><code class="REPLACEABLE c2">window_name</code> is a reference to a named window specification defined in the query's <code class="LITERAL">WINDOW</code> clause. Alternatively, a full <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">window_definition</code> can be given within parentheses, using the same syntax as for defining a named window in the <code class="LITERAL">WINDOW</code> clause; see the <a href="../sql-select/">SELECT</a> reference page for details. It's worth pointing out that <code class="LITERAL">OVER wname</code> is not exactly equivalent to <code class="LITERAL">OVER (wname)</code>; the latter implies copying and modifying the window definition, and will be rejected if the referenced window specification includes a frame clause.</p> <p>The <code class="LITERAL">PARTITION BY</code> option groups the rows of the query into <i class="FIRSTTERM">partitions</i>, which are processed separately by the window function. <code class="LITERAL">PARTITION BY</code> works similarly to a query-level <code class="LITERAL">GROUP BY</code> clause, except that its expressions are always just expressions and cannot be output-column names or numbers. Without <code class="LITERAL">PARTITION BY</code>, all rows produced by the query are treated as a single partition. The <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> option determines the order in which the rows of a partition are processed by the window function. It works similarly to a query-level <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> clause, but likewise cannot use output-column names or numbers. Without <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code>, rows are processed in an unspecified order.</p> <p>The <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_clause</code> specifies the set of rows constituting the <i class="FIRSTTERM">window frame</i>, which is a subset of the current partition, for those window functions that act on the frame instead of the whole partition. The frame can be specified in either <code class="LITERAL">RANGE</code> or <code class="LITERAL">ROWS</code> mode; in either case, it runs from the <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_start</code> to the <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_end</code>. If <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_end</code> is omitted, it defaults to <code class="LITERAL">CURRENT ROW</code>.</p> <p>A <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_start</code> of <code class="LITERAL">UNBOUNDED PRECEDING</code> means that the frame starts with the first row of the partition, and similarly a <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_end</code> of <code class="LITERAL">UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</code> means that the frame ends with the last row of the partition.</p> <p>In <code class="LITERAL">RANGE</code> mode, a <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_start</code> of <code class="LITERAL">CURRENT ROW</code> means the frame starts with the current row's first <i class="FIRSTTERM">peer</i> row (a row that <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> considers equivalent to the current row), while a <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_end</code> of <code class="LITERAL">CURRENT ROW</code> means the frame ends with the last equivalent <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> peer. In <code class="LITERAL">ROWS</code> mode, <code class="LITERAL">CURRENT ROW</code> simply means the current row.</p> <p>The <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">value</code> <code class="LITERAL">PRECEDING</code> and <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">value</code> <code class="LITERAL">FOLLOWING</code> cases are currently only allowed in <code class="LITERAL">ROWS</code> mode. They indicate that the frame starts or ends the specified number of rows before or after the current row. <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">value</code> must be an integer expression not containing any variables, aggregate functions, or window functions. The value must not be null or negative; but it can be zero, which just selects the current row.</p> <p>The default framing option is <code class="LITERAL">RANGE UNBOUNDED PRECEDING</code>, which is the same as <code class="LITERAL">RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW</code>. With <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code>, this sets the frame to be all rows from the partition start up through the current row's last <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> peer. Without <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code>, all rows of the partition are included in the window frame, since all rows become peers of the current row.</p> <p>Restrictions are that <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_start</code> cannot be <code class="LITERAL">UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</code>, <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_end</code> cannot be <code class="LITERAL">UNBOUNDED PRECEDING</code>, and the <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_end</code> choice cannot appear earlier in the above list than the <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">frame_start</code> choice — for example <code class="LITERAL">RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">value</code> PRECEDING</code> is not allowed.</p> <p>If <code class="LITERAL">FILTER</code> is specified, then only the input rows for which the <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">filter_clause</code> evaluates to true are fed to the window function; other rows are discarded. Only window functions that are aggregates accept a <code class="LITERAL">FILTER</code> clause.</p> <p>The built-in window functions are described in <a href="../functions-window/#FUNCTIONS-WINDOW-TABLE">Table 9-53</a>. Other window functions can be added by the user. Also, any built-in or user-defined normal aggregate function can be used as a window function. Ordered-set aggregates presently cannot be used as window functions, however.</p> <p>The syntaxes using <code class="LITERAL">*</code> are used for calling parameter-less aggregate functions as window functions, for example <code class="LITERAL">count(*) OVER (PARTITION BY x ORDER BY y)</code>. The asterisk (<code class="LITERAL">*</code>) is customarily not used for non-aggregate window functions. Aggregate window functions, unlike normal aggregate functions, do not allow <code class="LITERAL">DISTINCT</code> or <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> to be used within the function argument list.</p> <p>Window function calls are permitted only in the <code class="LITERAL">SELECT</code> list and the <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> clause of the query.</p> <p>More information about window functions can be found in <a href="../tutorial-window/">Section 3.5</a>, <a href="../functions-window/">Section 9.21</a>, and <a href="../queries-table-expressions/#QUERIES-WINDOW">Section 7.2.4</a>.</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="SQL-SYNTAX-TYPE-CASTS">4.2.9. Type Casts</h2> <p>A type cast specifies a conversion from one data type to another. <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> accepts two equivalent syntaxes for type casts:</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
CAST ( expression AS type )
expression::type
</pre> <p>The <code class="LITERAL">CAST</code> syntax conforms to SQL; the syntax with <code class="LITERAL">::</code> is historical <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> usage.</p> <p>When a cast is applied to a value expression of a known type, it represents a run-time type conversion. The cast will succeed only if a suitable type conversion operation has been defined. Notice that this is subtly different from the use of casts with constants, as shown in <a href="../sql-syntax-lexical/#SQL-SYNTAX-CONSTANTS-GENERIC">Section 4.1.2.7</a>. A cast applied to an unadorned string literal represents the initial assignment of a type to a literal constant value, and so it will succeed for any type (if the contents of the string literal are acceptable input syntax for the data type).</p> <p>An explicit type cast can usually be omitted if there is no ambiguity as to the type that a value expression must produce (for example, when it is assigned to a table column); the system will automatically apply a type cast in such cases. However, automatic casting is only done for casts that are marked <span class="QUOTE">"OK to apply implicitly"</span> in the system catalogs. Other casts must be invoked with explicit casting syntax. This restriction is intended to prevent surprising conversions from being applied silently.</p> <p>It is also possible to specify a type cast using a function-like syntax:</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
typename ( expression )
</pre> <p>However, this only works for types whose names are also valid as function names. For example, <code class="LITERAL">double precision</code> cannot be used this way, but the equivalent <code class="LITERAL">float8</code> can. Also, the names <code class="LITERAL">interval</code>, <code class="LITERAL">time</code>, and <code class="LITERAL">timestamp</code> can only be used in this fashion if they are double-quoted, because of syntactic conflicts. Therefore, the use of the function-like cast syntax leads to inconsistencies and should probably be avoided.</p>  <blockquote class="NOTE"> <p><b>Note:</b> The function-like syntax is in fact just a function call. When one of the two standard cast syntaxes is used to do a run-time conversion, it will internally invoke a registered function to perform the conversion. By convention, these conversion functions have the same name as their output type, and thus the <span class="QUOTE">"function-like syntax"</span> is nothing more than a direct invocation of the underlying conversion function. Obviously, this is not something that a portable application should rely on.

Collation Expressions</h2> <p>The <code class="LITERAL">COLLATE</code> clause overrides the collation of an expression. It is appended to the expression it applies to:</p> <pre class="SYNOPSIS" data-language="sql">
expr COLLATE collation
</pre> <p>where <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">collation</code> is a possibly schema-qualified identifier. The <code class="LITERAL">COLLATE</code> clause binds tighter than operators; parentheses can be used when necessary.</p> <p>If no collation is explicitly specified, the database system either derives a collation from the columns involved in the expression, or it defaults to the default collation of the database if no column is involved in the expression.</p> <p>The two common uses of the <code class="LITERAL">COLLATE</code> clause are overriding the sort order in an <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code> clause, for example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT a, b, c FROM tbl WHERE ... ORDER BY a COLLATE "C";
</pre> <p>and overriding the collation of a function or operator call that has locale-sensitive results, for example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE a &gt; 'foo' COLLATE "C";
</pre> <p>Note that in the latter case the <code class="LITERAL">COLLATE</code> clause is attached to an input argument of the operator we wish to affect. It doesn't matter which argument of the operator or function call the <code class="LITERAL">COLLATE</code> clause is attached to, because the collation that is applied by the operator or function is derived by considering all arguments, and an explicit <code class="LITERAL">COLLATE</code> clause will override the collations of all other arguments. (Attaching non-matching <code class="LITERAL">COLLATE</code> clauses to more than one argument, however, is an error. For more details see <a href="../collation/">Section 22.2</a>.) Thus, this gives the same result as the previous example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE a COLLATE "C" &gt; 'foo';
</pre> <p>But this is an error:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE (a &gt; 'foo') COLLATE "C";
</pre> <p>because it attempts to apply a collation to the result of the <code class="LITERAL">&gt;</code> operator, which is of the non-collatable data type <code class="TYPE">boolean</code>.</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="SQL-SYNTAX-SCALAR-SUBQUERIES">4.2.11. Scalar Subqueries</h2> <p>A scalar subquery is an ordinary <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code> query in parentheses that returns exactly one row with one column. (See <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/queries.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a> for information about writing queries.) The <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code> query is executed and the single returned value is used in the surrounding value expression. It is an error to use a query that returns more than one row or more than one column as a scalar subquery. (But if, during a particular execution, the subquery returns no rows, there is no error; the scalar result is taken to be null.) The subquery can refer to variables from the surrounding query, which will act as constants during any one evaluation of the subquery. See also <a href="../functions-subquery/">Section 9.22</a> for other expressions involving subqueries.</p> <p>For example, the following finds the largest city population in each state:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT name, (SELECT max(pop) FROM cities WHERE cities.state = states.name)
    FROM states;

Array Constructors</h2> <p>An array constructor is an expression that builds an array value using values for its member elements. A simple array constructor consists of the key word <code class="LITERAL">ARRAY</code>, a left square bracket <code class="LITERAL">[</code>, a list of expressions (separated by commas) for the array element values, and finally a right square bracket <code class="LITERAL">]</code>. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT ARRAY[1,2,3+4];
  array
---------
 {1,2,7}
(1 row)
</pre> <p>By default, the array element type is the common type of the member expressions, determined using the same rules as for <code class="LITERAL">UNION</code> or <code class="LITERAL">CASE</code> constructs (see <a href="../typeconv-union-case/">Section 10.5</a>). You can override this by explicitly casting the array constructor to the desired type, for example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT ARRAY[1,2,22.7]::integer[];
  array
----------
 {1,2,23}
(1 row)
</pre> <p>This has the same effect as casting each expression to the array element type individually. For more on casting, see <a href="../sql-expressions/#SQL-SYNTAX-TYPE-CASTS">Section 4.2.9</a>.</p> <p>Multidimensional array values can be built by nesting array constructors. In the inner constructors, the key word <code class="LITERAL">ARRAY</code> can be omitted. For example, these produce the same result:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT ARRAY[ARRAY[1,2], ARRAY[3,4]];
     array
---------------
 {{1,2},{3,4}}
(1 row)

SELECT ARRAY[[1,2],[3,4]];
     array
---------------
 {{1,2},{3,4}}
(1 row)
</pre> <p>Since multidimensional arrays must be rectangular, inner constructors at the same level must produce sub-arrays of identical dimensions. Any cast applied to the outer <code class="LITERAL">ARRAY</code> constructor propagates automatically to all the inner constructors.</p> <p>Multidimensional array constructor elements can be anything yielding an array of the proper kind, not only a sub-<code class="LITERAL">ARRAY</code> construct. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
CREATE TABLE arr(f1 int[], f2 int[]);

INSERT INTO arr VALUES (ARRAY[[1,2],[3,4]], ARRAY[[5,6],[7,8]]);

SELECT ARRAY[f1, f2, '{{9,10},{11,12}}'::int[]] FROM arr;
                     array
------------------------------------------------
 {{{1,2},{3,4}},{{5,6},{7,8}},{{9,10},{11,12}}}
(1 row)
</pre> <p>You can construct an empty array, but since it's impossible to have an array with no type, you must explicitly cast your empty array to the desired type. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT ARRAY[]::integer[];
 array
-------
 {}
(1 row)
</pre> <p>It is also possible to construct an array from the results of a subquery. In this form, the array constructor is written with the key word <code class="LITERAL">ARRAY</code> followed by a parenthesized (not bracketed) subquery. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT ARRAY(SELECT oid FROM pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE 'bytea%');
                                 array

(1 row)
</pre> <p>The subquery must return a single column. The resulting one-dimensional array will have an element for each row in the subquery result, with an element type matching that of the subquery's output column.</p> <p>The subscripts of an array value built with <code class="LITERAL">ARRAY</code> always begin with one.

Row Constructors</h2> <p>A row constructor is an expression that builds a row value (also called a composite value) using values for its member fields. A row constructor consists of the key word <code class="LITERAL">ROW</code>, a left parenthesis, zero or more expressions (separated by commas) for the row field values, and finally a right parenthesis. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT ROW(1,2.5,'this is a test');
</pre> <p>The key word <code class="LITERAL">ROW</code> is optional when there is more than one expression in the list.</p> <p>A row constructor can include the syntax <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">rowvalue</code><code class="LITERAL">.*</code>, which will be expanded to a list of the elements of the row value, just as occurs when the <code class="LITERAL">.*</code> syntax is used at the top level of a <code class="COMMAND">SELECT</code> list (see <a href="../rowtypes/#ROWTYPES-USAGE">Section 8.16.5</a>). For example, if table <code class="LITERAL">t</code> has columns <code class="LITERAL">f1</code> and <code class="LITERAL">f2</code>, these are the same:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT ROW(t.*, 42) FROM t;
SELECT ROW(t.f1, t.f2, 42) FROM t;
</pre>  <blockquote class="NOTE"> <p><b>Note:</b> Before <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> 8.2, the <code class="LITERAL">.*</code> syntax was not expanded in row constructors, so that writing <code class="LITERAL">ROW(t.*, 42)</code> created a two-field row whose first field was another row value. The new behavior is usually more useful. If you need the old behavior of nested row values, write the inner row value without <code class="LITERAL">.*</code>, for instance <code class="LITERAL">ROW(t, 42)</code>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>By default, the value created by a <code class="LITERAL">ROW</code> expression is of an anonymous record type. If necessary, it can be cast to a named composite type — either the row type of a table, or a composite type created with <code class="COMMAND">CREATE TYPE AS</code>. An explicit cast might be needed to avoid ambiguity. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
CREATE TABLE mytable(f1 int, f2 float, f3 text);

CREATE FUNCTION getf1(mytable) RETURNS int AS 'SELECT $1.f1' LANGUAGE SQL;

-- No cast needed since only one getf1() exists
SELECT getf1(ROW(1,2.5,'this is a test'));

(1 row)

CREATE TYPE myrowtype AS (f1 int, f2 text, f3 numeric);

CREATE FUNCTION getf1(myrowtype) RETURNS int AS 'SELECT $1.f1' LANGUAGE SQL;

SELECT getf1(CAST(ROW(11,'this is a test',2.5) AS myrowtype));
 getf1
-------
    11
(1 row)
</pre> <p>Row constructors can be used to build composite values to be stored in a composite-type table column, or to be passed to a function that accepts a composite parameter. Also, it is possible to compare two row values or test a row with <code class="LITERAL">IS NULL</code> or <code class="LITERAL">IS NOT NULL</code>, for example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT ROW(1,2.5,'this is a test') = ROW(1, 3, 'not the same');

SELECT ROW(table.*) IS NULL FROM table;  -- detect all-null rows

Expression Evaluation Rules</h2> <p>The order of evaluation of subexpressions is not defined. In particular, the inputs of an operator or function are not necessarily evaluated left-to-right or in any other fixed order.</p> <p>Furthermore, if the result of an expression can be determined by evaluating only some parts of it, then other subexpressions might not be evaluated at all. For instance, if one wrote:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT true OR somefunc();
</pre> <p>then <code class="LITERAL">somefunc()</code> would (probably) not be called at all. The same would be the case if one wrote:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT somefunc() OR true;
</pre> <p>Note that this is not the same as the left-to-right <span class="QUOTE">"short-circuiting"</span> of Boolean operators that is found in some programming languages.</p> <p>As a consequence, it is unwise to use functions with side effects as part of complex expressions. It is particularly dangerous to rely on side effects or evaluation order in <code class="LITERAL">WHERE</code> and <code class="LITERAL">HAVING</code> clauses, since those clauses are extensively reprocessed as part of developing an execution plan. Boolean expressions (<code class="LITERAL">AND</code>/<code class="LITERAL">OR</code>/<code class="LITERAL">NOT</code> combinations) in those clauses can be reorganized in any manner allowed by the laws of Boolean algebra.</p> <p>When it is essential to force evaluation order, a <code class="LITERAL">CASE</code> construct (see <a href="../functions-conditional/">Section 9.17</a>) can be used. For example, this is an untrustworthy way of trying to avoid division by zero in a <code class="LITERAL">WHERE</code> clause:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT ... WHERE x &gt; 0 AND y/x &gt; 1.5;
</pre> <p>But this is safe:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT ... WHERE CASE WHEN x &gt; 0 THEN y/x &gt; 1.5 ELSE false END;
</pre> <p>A <code class="LITERAL">CASE</code> construct used in this fashion will defeat optimization attempts, so it should only be done when necessary. (In this particular example, it would be better to sidestep the problem by writing <code class="LITERAL">y &gt; 1.5*x</code> instead.)</p> <p><code class="LITERAL">CASE</code> is not a cure-all for such issues, however. One limitation of the technique illustrated above is that it does not prevent early evaluation of constant subexpressions. As described in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/xfunc-volatility.html" target="_blank">Section 35.6</a>, functions and operators marked <code class="LITERAL">IMMUTABLE</code> can be evaluated when the query is planned rather than when it is executed. Thus for example</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT CASE WHEN x &gt; 0 THEN x ELSE 1/0 END FROM tab;
</pre> <p>is likely to result in a division-by-zero failure due to the planner trying to simplify the constant subexpression, even if every row in the table has <code class="LITERAL">x &gt; 0</code> so that the <code class="LITERAL">ELSE</code> arm would never be entered at run time.</p> <p>While that particular example might seem silly, related cases that don't obviously involve constants can occur in queries executed within functions, since the values of function arguments and local variables can be inserted into queries as constants for planning purposes. Within <span class="APPLICATION">PL/pgSQL</span> functions, for example, using an <code class="LITERAL">IF</code>-<code class="LITERAL">THEN</code>-<code class="LITERAL">ELSE</code> statement to protect a risky computation is much safer than just nesting it in a <code class="LITERAL">CASE</code> expression.</p> <p>Another limitation of the same kind is that a <code class="LITERAL">CASE</code> cannot prevent evaluation of an aggregate expression contained within it, because aggregate expressions are computed before other expressions in a <code class="LITERAL">SELECT</code> list or <code class="LITERAL">HAVING</code> clause are considered. For example, the following query can cause a division-by-zero error despite seemingly having protected against it:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
SELECT CASE WHEN min(employees) &gt; 0
            THEN avg(expenses / employees)
       END
    FROM departments;
</pre> <p>The <code class="FUNCTION">min()</code> and <code class="FUNCTION">avg()</code> aggregates are computed concurrently over all the input rows, so if any row has <code class="STRUCTFIELD">employees</code> equal to zero, the division-by-zero error will occur before there is any opportunity to test the result of <code class="FUNCTION">min()</code>. Instead, use a <code class="LITERAL">WHERE</code> or <code class="LITERAL">FILTER</code> clause to prevent problematic input rows from reaching an aggregate function in the first place.</p> </div>  <div class="NAVFOOTER">  <table summary="Footer navigation table"> <tr> <td width="33%" align="left"><a href="../sql-syntax-lexical/" accesskey="P">Prev</a></td> <td width="34%" align="center"></td> <td width="33%" align="right"><a href="../sql-syntax-calling-funcs/" accesskey="N">Next</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="33%" align="left">Lexical Structure</td> <td width="34%" align="center"><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-syntax.html" accesskey="U" target="_blank">Up</a></td> <td width="33%" align="right">Calling Functions</td> </tr> </table> </div>
