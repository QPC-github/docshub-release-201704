<h1 class="SECT1" id="DYNAMIC-TRACE">27.4. Dynamic Tracing</h1> <p><span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> provides facilities to support dynamic tracing of the database server. This allows an external utility to be called at specific points in the code and thereby trace execution.</p> <p>A number of probes or trace points are already inserted into the source code. These probes are intended to be used by database developers and administrators. By default the probes are not compiled into <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span>; the user needs to explicitly tell the configure script to make the probes available.</p> <p>Currently, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace" target="_blank">DTrace</a> utility is supported, which, at the time of this writing, is available on Solaris, OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Oracle Linux. The <a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/" target="_blank">SystemTap</a> project for Linux provides a DTrace equivalent and can also be used. Supporting other dynamic tracing utilities is theoretically possible by changing the definitions for the macros in <code class="FILENAME">src/include/utils/probes.h</code>.</p> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="COMPILING-FOR-TRACE">27.4.1.

One point worth noting is that at this writing, SystemTap scripts must reference probe names using double underscores in place of hyphens. This is expected to be fixed in future SystemTap releases.</p> </blockquote>  <p>You should remember that DTrace scripts need to be carefully written and debugged, otherwise the trace information collected might be meaningless. In most cases where problems are found it is the instrumentation that is at fault, not the underlying system. When discussing information found using dynamic tracing, be sure to enclose the script used to allow that too to be checked and discussed.</p> <p>More example scripts can be found in the PgFoundry <a href="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/dtrace/" target="_blank">dtrace project</a>.</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="DEFINING-TRACE-POINTS">27.4.4. Defining New Probes</h2> <p>New probes can be defined within the code wherever the developer desires, though this will require a recompilation. Below are the steps for inserting new probes:</p> <div class="PROCEDURE"> <ol type="1"> <li class="STEP"> <p>Decide on probe names and data to be made available through the probes</p> </li> <li class="STEP"> <p>Add the probe definitions to <code class="FILENAME">src/backend/utils/probes.d</code></p> </li> <li class="STEP"> <p>Include <code class="FILENAME">pg_trace.h</code> if it is not already present in the module(s) containing the probe points, and insert <code class="LITERAL">TRACE_POSTGRESQL</code> probe macros at the desired locations in the source code</p> </li> <li class="STEP"> <p>Recompile and verify that the new probes are available</p> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="FORMALPARA"> <p><b>Example:</b> Here is an example of how you would add a probe to trace all new transactions by transaction ID.</p> </div> <div class="PROCEDURE"> <ol type="1"> <li class="STEP"> <p>Decide that the probe will be named <code class="LITERAL">transaction-start</code> and requires a parameter of type LocalTransactionId</p> </li> <li class="STEP"> <p>Add the probe definition to <code class="FILENAME">src/backend/utils/probes.d</code>:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
probe transaction__start(LocalTransactionId);
</pre> <p>Note the use of the double underline in the probe name. In a DTrace script using the probe, the double underline needs to be replaced with a hyphen, so <code class="LITERAL">transaction-start</code> is the name to document for users.</p> </li> <li class="STEP"> <p>At compile time, <code class="LITERAL">transaction__start</code> is converted to a macro called <code class="LITERAL">TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START</code> (notice the underscores are single here), which is available by including <code class="FILENAME">pg_trace.h</code>. Add the macro call to the appropriate location in the source code. In this case, it looks like the following:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START(vxid.localTransactionId);
</pre> </li> <li class="STEP"> <p>After recompiling and running the new binary, check that your newly added probe is available by executing the following DTrace command. You should see similar output:</p> <pre class="SCREEN">
# dtrace -ln transaction-start
   ID    PROVIDER          MODULE           FUNCTION NAME
18705 postgresql49878     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start

18855 postgresql49875     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
18986 postgresql49873     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
</pre> </li> </ol> </div> <p>There are a few things to be careful about when adding trace macros to the C code:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You should take care that the data types specified for a probe's parameters match the data types of the variables used in the macro. Otherwise, you will get compilation errors.</p> </li> <li> <p>On most platforms, if <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> is built with <code class="OPTION">--enable-dtrace</code>, the arguments to a trace macro will be evaluated whenever control passes through the macro, <span class="emphasis EMPHASIS c3">even if no tracing is being done</span>. This is usually not worth worrying about if you are just reporting the values of a few local variables. But beware of putting expensive function calls into the arguments. If you need to do that, consider protecting the macro with a check to see if the trace is actually enabled:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
if (TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START_ENABLED())
    TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START(some_function(...));
