<h1 class="SECT1" id="SERVER-START">17.3. Starting the Database Server</h1> <p>Before anyone can access the database, you must start the database server. The database server program is called <code class="COMMAND">postgres</code>. The <code class="COMMAND">postgres</code> program must know where to find the data it is supposed to use. This is done with the <code class="OPTION">-D</code> option. Thus, the simplest way to start the server is:</p> <pre class="SCREEN">
$ postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
</pre> <p>which will leave the server running in the foreground. This must be done while logged into the <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> user account. Without <code class="OPTION">-D</code>, the server will try to use the data directory named by the environment variable <code class="ENVAR">PGDATA</code>. If that variable is not provided either, it will fail.</p> <p>Normally it is better to start <code class="COMMAND">postgres</code> in the background. For this, use the usual Unix shell syntax:</p> <pre class="SCREEN">
$ postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data &gt;logfile 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
</pre> <p>It is important to store the server's <span class="SYSTEMITEM">stdout</span> and <span class="SYSTEMITEM">stderr</span> output somewhere, as shown above. It will help for auditing purposes and to diagnose problems. (See <a href="../logfile-maintenance/">Section 23.3</a> for a more thorough discussion of log file handling.)</p> <p>The <code class="COMMAND">postgres</code> program also takes a number of other command-line options. For more information, see the <a href="../app-postgres/"><span class="APPLICATION">postgres</span></a> reference page and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/runtime-config.html" target="_blank">Chapter 18</a> below.</p> <p>This shell syntax can get tedious quickly. Therefore the wrapper program <a href="../app-pg-ctl/"><span class="APPLICATION">pg_ctl</span></a> is provided to simplify some tasks. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
pg_ctl start -l logfile
</pre> <p>will start the server in the background and put the output into the named log file. The <code class="OPTION">-D</code> option has the same meaning here as for <code class="COMMAND">postgres</code>. <code class="COMMAND">pg_ctl</code> is also capable of stopping the server.</p> <p>Normally, you will want to start the database server when the computer boots. Autostart scripts are operating-system-specific. There are a few distributed with <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> in the <code class="FILENAME">contrib/start-scripts</code> directory. Installing one will require root privileges.</p> <p>Different systems have different conventions for starting up daemons at boot time. Many systems have a file <code class="FILENAME">/etc/rc.local</code> or <code class="FILENAME">/etc/rc.d/rc.local</code>. Others use <code class="FILENAME">init.d</code> or <code class="FILENAME">rc.d</code> directories. Whatever you do, the server must be run by the <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> user account <span class="emphasis EMPHASIS c2">and not by root</span> or any other user. Therefore you probably should form your commands using <code class="LITERAL">su postgres -c '...'</code>. For example:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
su postgres -c 'pg_ctl start -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l serverlog'
</pre> <p>Here are a few more operating-system-specific suggestions. (In each case be sure to use the proper installation directory and user name where we show generic values.)</p> <ul> <li> <p>For <span class="PRODUCTNAME">FreeBSD</span>, look at the file <code class="FILENAME">contrib/start-scripts/freebsd</code> in the <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> source distribution.</p> </li> <li> <p>On <span class="PRODUCTNAME">OpenBSD</span>, add the following lines to the file <code class="FILENAME">/etc/rc.local</code>:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
if [ -x /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -a -x /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres ]; then
    su -l postgres -c '/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl start -s -l /var/postgresql/log -D /usr/local/pgsql/data'
    echo -n ' postgresql'
fi
</pre> </li> <li> <p>On <span class="PRODUCTNAME">Linux</span> systems either add</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl start -l logfile -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
</pre> <p>to <code class="FILENAME">/etc/rc.d/rc.local</code> or <code class="FILENAME">/etc/rc.local</code> or look at the file <code class="FILENAME">contrib/start-scripts/linux</code> in the <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> source distribution.</p> </li> <li> <p>On <span class="PRODUCTNAME">NetBSD</span>, use either the <span class="PRODUCTNAME">FreeBSD</span> or <span class="PRODUCTNAME">Linux</span> start scripts, depending on preference.</p> </li> <li> <p>On <span class="PRODUCTNAME">Solaris</span>, create a file called <code class="FILENAME">/etc/init.d/postgresql</code> that contains the following line:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
su - postgres -c "/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl start -l logfile -D /usr/local/pgsql/data"
</pre> <p>Then, create a symbolic link to it in <code class="FILENAME">/etc/rc3.d</code> as <code class="FILENAME">S99postgresql</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>While the server is running, its <acronym class="ACRONYM">PID</acronym> is stored in the file <code class="FILENAME">postmaster.pid</code> in the data directory. This is used to prevent multiple server instances from running in the same data directory and can also be used for shutting down the server.</p> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="SERVER-START-FAILURES">17.3.1. Server Start-up Failures</h2> <p>There are several common reasons the server might fail to start. Check the server's log file, or start it by hand (without redirecting standard output or standard error) and see what error messages appear. Below we explain some of the most common error messages in more detail.</p> <pre class="SCREEN">
LOG:  could not bind IPv4 socket: Address already in use
HINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 5432? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.
FATAL:  could not create TCP/IP listen socket
</pre> <p>This usually means just what it suggests: you tried to start another server on the same port where one is already running. However, if the kernel error message is not <samp class="COMPUTEROUTPUT">Address already in use</samp> or some variant of that, there might be a different problem. For example, trying to start a server on a reserved port number might draw something like:</p> <pre class="SCREEN">
$ postgres -p 666
LOG:  could not bind IPv4 socket: Permission denied
HINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 666? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.
FATAL:  could not create TCP/IP listen socket
</pre> <p>A message like:</p> <pre class="SCREEN">
FATAL:  could not create shared memory segment: Invalid argument
DETAIL:  Failed system call was shmget(key=5440001, size=4011376640, 03600).
</pre> <p>probably means your kernel's limit on the size of shared memory is smaller than the work area <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> is trying to create (4011376640 bytes in this example). Or it could mean that you do not have System-V-style shared memory support configured into your kernel at all. As a temporary workaround, you can try starting the server with a smaller-than-normal number of buffers (<a href="../runtime-config-resource/#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS">shared_buffers</a>). You will eventually want to reconfigure your kernel to increase the allowed shared memory size. You might also see this message when trying to start multiple servers on the same machine, if their total space requested exceeds the kernel limit.</p> <p>An error like:</p> <pre class="SCREEN">
FATAL:  could not create semaphores: No space left on device
DETAIL:  Failed system call was semget(5440126, 17, 03600).
</pre> <p>does <span class="emphasis EMPHASIS c2">not</span> mean you've run out of disk space. It means your kernel's limit on the number of <span class="SYSTEMITEM">System V</span> semaphores is smaller than the number <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> wants to create. As above, you might be able to work around the problem by starting the server with a reduced number of allowed connections (<a href="../runtime-config-connection/#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS">max_connections</a>), but you'll eventually want to increase the kernel limit.</p> <p>If you get an <span class="QUOTE">"illegal system call"</span> error, it is likely that shared memory or semaphores are not supported in your kernel at all. In that case your only option is to reconfigure the kernel to enable these features.</p> <p>Details about configuring <span class="SYSTEMITEM">System V</span> <acronym class="ACRONYM">IPC</acronym> facilities are given in <a href="../kernel-resources/#SYSVIPC">Section 17.4.1</a>.</p> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="CLIENT-CONNECTION-PROBLEMS">17.3.2. Client Connection Problems</h2> <p>Although the error conditions possible on the client side are quite varied and application-dependent, a few of them might be directly related to how the server was started. Conditions other than those shown below should be documented with the respective client application.</p> <pre class="SCREEN">
psql: could not connect to server: Connection refused
        Is the server running on host "server.joe.com" and accepting
        TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
</pre> <p>This is the generic <span class="QUOTE">"I couldn't find a server to talk to"</span> failure. It looks like the above when TCP/IP communication is attempted. A common mistake is to forget to configure the server to allow TCP/IP connections.</p> <p>Alternatively, you'll get this when attempting Unix-domain socket communication to a local server:</p> <pre class="SCREEN">
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
</pre> <p>The last line is useful in verifying that the client is trying to connect to the right place. If there is in fact no server running there, the kernel error message will typically be either <samp class="COMPUTEROUTPUT">Connection refused</samp> or <samp class="COMPUTEROUTPUT">No such file or directory</samp>, as illustrated. (It is important to realize that <samp class="COMPUTEROUTPUT">Connection refused</samp> in this context does <span class="emphasis EMPHASIS c2">not</span> mean that the server got your connection request and rejected it. That case will produce a different message, as shown in <a href="../client-authentication-problems/">Section 19.4</a>.) Other error messages such as <samp class="COMPUTEROUTPUT">Connection timed out</samp> might indicate more fundamental problems, like lack of network connectivity.</p> </div>  <div class="NAVFOOTER">  <table summary="Footer navigation table"> <tr> <td width="33%" align="left"><a href="../creating-cluster/" accesskey="P">Prev</a></td> <td width="34%" align="center"></td> <td width="33%" align="right"><a href="../kernel-resources/" accesskey="N">Next</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="33%" align="left">Creating a Database Cluster</td> <td width="34%" align="center"><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/runtime.html" accesskey="U" target="_blank">Up</a></td> <td width="33%" align="right">Managing Kernel Resources</td> </tr> </table> </div>
