This is to prevent confusing the command tag with the data that was just printed.</p> </blockquote>  </div> <div class="REFSECT1" id="AEN72230">  <h2>Notes</h2> <p><code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> can only be used with plain tables, not with views. However, you can write <code class="LITERAL">COPY (SELECT * FROM <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">viewname</code>) TO ...</code>.</p> <p><code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> only deals with the specific table named; it does not copy data to or from child tables. Thus for example <code class="LITERAL">COPY <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">table</code> TO</code> shows the same data as <code class="LITERAL">SELECT * FROM ONLY <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">table</code></code>. But <code class="LITERAL">COPY (SELECT * FROM <code class="REPLACEABLE c2">table</code>) TO ...</code> can be used to dump all of the data in an inheritance hierarchy.</p> <p>You must have select privilege on the table whose values are read by <code class="COMMAND">COPY TO</code>, and insert privilege on the table into which values are inserted by <code class="COMMAND">COPY FROM</code>. It is sufficient to have column privileges on the column(s) listed in the command.</p> <p>Files named in a <code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> command are read or written directly by the server, not by the client application. Therefore, they must reside on or be accessible to the database server machine, not the client. They must be accessible to and readable or writable by the <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> user (the user ID the server runs as), not the client. Similarly, the command specified with <code class="LITERAL">PROGRAM</code> is executed directly by the server, not by the client application, must be executable by the <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> user. <code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> naming a file or command is only allowed to database superusers, since it allows reading or writing any file that the server has privileges to access.</p> <p>Do not confuse <code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> with the <span class="APPLICATION">psql</span> instruction <code class="COMMAND"><a href="../app-psql/#APP-PSQL-META-COMMANDS-COPY">\copy</a></code>. <code class="COMMAND">\copy</code> invokes <code class="COMMAND">COPY FROM STDIN</code> or <code class="COMMAND">COPY TO STDOUT</code>, and then fetches/stores the data in a file accessible to the <span class="APPLICATION">psql</span> client. Thus, file accessibility and access rights depend on the client rather than the server when <code class="COMMAND">\copy</code> is used.</p> <p>It is recommended that the file name used in <code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> always be specified as an absolute path. This is enforced by the server in the case of <code class="COMMAND">COPY TO</code>, but for <code class="COMMAND">COPY FROM</code> you do have the option of reading from a file specified by a relative path. The path will be interpreted relative to the working directory of the server process (normally the cluster's data directory), not the client's working directory.</p> <p>Executing a command with <code class="LITERAL">PROGRAM</code> might be restricted by the operating system's access control mechanisms, such as SELinux.</p> <p><code class="COMMAND">COPY FROM</code> will invoke any triggers and check constraints on the destination table. However, it will not invoke rules.</p> <p><code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> input and output is affected by <code class="VARNAME">DateStyle</code>. To ensure portability to other <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> installations that might use non-default <code class="VARNAME">DateStyle</code> settings, <code class="VARNAME">DateStyle</code> should be set to <code class="LITERAL">ISO</code> before using <code class="COMMAND">COPY TO</code>. It is also a good idea to avoid dumping data with <code class="VARNAME">IntervalStyle</code> set to <code class="LITERAL">sql_standard</code>, because negative interval values might be misinterpreted by a server that has a different setting for <code class="VARNAME">IntervalStyle</code>.</p> <p>Input data is interpreted according to <code class="LITERAL">ENCODING</code> option or the current client encoding, and output data is encoded in <code class="LITERAL">ENCODING</code> or the current client encoding, even if the data does not pass through the client but is read from or written to a file directly by the server.</p> <p><code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> stops operation at the first error. This should not lead to problems in the event of a <code class="COMMAND">COPY TO</code>, but the target table will already have received earlier rows in a <code class="COMMAND">COPY FROM</code>. These rows will not be visible or accessible, but they still occupy disk space. This might amount to a considerable amount of wasted disk space if the failure happened well into a large copy operation. You might wish to invoke <code class="COMMAND">VACUUM</code> to recover the wasted space.</p> <p><code class="LITERAL">FORCE_NULL</code> and <code class="LITERAL">FORCE_NOT_NULL</code> can be used simultaneously on the same column. This results in converting quoted null strings to null values and unquoted null strings to empty strings.</p> </div> <div class="REFSECT1" id="AEN72293">  <h2>File Formats</h2> <div class="REFSECT2" id="AEN72295">  <h3>Text Format</h3> <p>When the <code class="LITERAL">text</code> format is used, the data read or written is a text file with one line per table row. Columns in a row are separated by the delimiter character. The column values themselves are strings generated by the output function, or acceptable to the input function, of each attribute's data type. The specified null string is used in place of columns that are null. <code class="COMMAND">COPY FROM</code> will raise an error if any line of the input file contains more or fewer columns than are expected. If <code class="LITERAL">OIDS</code> is specified, the OID is read or written as the first column, preceding the user data columns.</p> <p>End of data can be represented by a single line containing just backslash-period (<code class="LITERAL">\.</code>). An end-of-data marker is not necessary when reading from a file, since the end of file serves perfectly well; it is needed only when copying data to or from client applications using pre-3.0 client protocol.</p> <p>Backslash characters (<code class="LITERAL">\</code>) can be used in the <code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> data to quote data characters that might otherwise be taken as row or column delimiters. In particular, the following characters <span class="emphasis EMPHASIS c3">must</span> be preceded by a backslash if they appear as part of a column value: backslash itself, newline, carriage return, and the current delimiter character.</p> <p>The specified null string is sent by <code class="COMMAND">COPY TO</code> without adding any backslashes; conversely, <code class="COMMAND">COPY FROM</code> matches the input against the null string before removing backslashes. Therefore, a null string such as <code class="LITERAL">\N</code> cannot be confused with the actual data value <code class="LITERAL">\N</code> (which would be represented as <code class="LITERAL">\\N</code>).</p> <p>The following special backslash sequences are recognized by <code class="COMMAND">COPY FROM</code>:</p> <div class="INFORMALTABLE" id="AEN72315">  <table class="CALSTABLE"> <col> <col> <thead> <tr> <th>Sequence</th> <th>Represents</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code class="LITERAL">\b</code></td> <td>Backspace (ASCII 8)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="LITERAL">\f</code></td> <td>Form feed (ASCII 12)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="LITERAL">\n</code></td> <td>Newline (ASCII 10)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="LITERAL">\r</code></td> <td>Carriage return (ASCII 13)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="LITERAL">\t</code></td> <td>Tab (ASCII 9)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="LITERAL">\v</code></td> <td>Vertical tab (ASCII 11)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>
<code class="LITERAL">\</code><code class="REPLACEABLE c2">digits</code>
</td> <td>Backslash followed by one to three octal digits specifies the character with that numeric code</td> </tr> <tr> <td>
<code class="LITERAL">\x</code><code class="REPLACEABLE c2">digits</code>
</td> <td>Backslash <code class="LITERAL">x</code> followed by one or two hex digits specifies the character with that numeric code</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div>Presently, <code class="COMMAND">COPY TO</code> will never emit an octal or hex-digits backslash sequence, but it does use the other sequences listed above for those control characters. <p>Any other backslashed character that is not mentioned in the above table will be taken to represent itself. However, beware of adding backslashes unnecessarily, since that might accidentally produce a string matching the end-of-data marker (<code class="LITERAL">\.</code>) or the null string (<code class="LITERAL">\N</code> by default). These strings will be recognized before any other backslash processing is done.</p> <p>It is strongly recommended that applications generating <code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> data convert data newlines and carriage returns to the <code class="LITERAL">\n</code> and <code class="LITERAL">\r</code> sequences respectively. At present it is possible to represent a data carriage return by a backslash and carriage return, and to represent a data newline by a backslash and newline. However, these representations might not be accepted in future releases. They are also highly vulnerable to corruption if the <code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> file is transferred across different machines (for example, from Unix to Windows or vice versa).</p> <p><code class="COMMAND">COPY TO</code> will terminate each row with a Unix-style newline (<span class="QUOTE">"<code class="LITERAL">\n</code>"</span>). Servers running on Microsoft Windows instead output carriage return/newline (<span class="QUOTE">"<code class="LITERAL">\r\n</code>"</span>), but only for <code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> to a server file; for consistency across platforms, <code class="COMMAND">COPY TO STDOUT</code> always sends <span class="QUOTE">"<code class="LITERAL">\n</code>"</span> regardless of server platform. <code class="COMMAND">COPY FROM</code> can handle lines ending with newlines, carriage returns, or carriage return/newlines. To reduce the risk of error due to un-backslashed newlines or carriage returns that were meant as data, <code class="COMMAND">COPY FROM</code> will complain if the line endings in the input are not all alike.</p> </div> <div class="REFSECT2" id="AEN72378">  <h3>CSV Format</h3> <p>This format option is used for importing and exporting the Comma Separated Value (<code class="LITERAL">CSV</code>) file format used by many other programs, such as spreadsheets. Instead of the escaping rules used by <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span>'s standard text format, it produces and recognizes the common CSV escaping mechanism.</p> <p>The values in each record are separated by the <code class="LITERAL">DELIMITER</code> character. If the value contains the delimiter character, the <code class="LITERAL">QUOTE</code> character, the <code class="LITERAL">NULL</code> string, a carriage return, or line feed character, then the whole value is prefixed and suffixed by the <code class="LITERAL">QUOTE</code> character, and any occurrence within the value of a <code class="LITERAL">QUOTE</code> character or the <code class="LITERAL">ESCAPE</code> character is preceded by the escape character. You can also use <code class="LITERAL">FORCE_QUOTE</code> to force quotes when outputting non-<code class="LITERAL">NULL</code> values in specific columns.</p> <p>The <code class="LITERAL">CSV</code> format has no standard way to distinguish a <code class="LITERAL">NULL</code> value from an empty string. <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span>'s <code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> handles this by quoting. A <code class="LITERAL">NULL</code> is output as the <code class="LITERAL">NULL</code> parameter string and is not quoted, while a non-<code class="LITERAL">NULL</code> value matching the <code class="LITERAL">NULL</code> parameter string is quoted. For example, with the default settings, a <code class="LITERAL">NULL</code> is written as an unquoted empty string, while an empty string data value is written with double quotes (<code class="LITERAL">""</code>). Reading values follows similar rules. You can use <code class="LITERAL">FORCE_NOT_NULL</code> to prevent <code class="LITERAL">NULL</code> input comparisons for specific columns. You can also use <code class="LITERAL">FORCE_NULL</code> to convert quoted null string data values to <code class="LITERAL">NULL</code>.</p> <p>Because backslash is not a special character in the <code class="LITERAL">CSV</code> format, <code class="LITERAL">\.</code>, the end-of-data marker, could also appear as a data value. To avoid any misinterpretation, a <code class="LITERAL">\.</code> data value appearing as a lone entry on a line is automatically quoted on output, and on input, if quoted, is not interpreted as the end-of-data marker. If you are loading a file created by another application that has a single unquoted column and might have a value of <code class="LITERAL">\.</code>, you might need to quote that value in the input file.</p>  <blockquote class="NOTE"> <p><b>Note:</b> In <code class="LITERAL">CSV</code> format, all characters are significant. A quoted value surrounded by white space, or any characters other than <code class="LITERAL">DELIMITER</code>, will include those characters. This can cause errors if you import data from a system that pads <code class="LITERAL">CSV</code> lines with white space out to some fixed width. If such a situation arises you might need to preprocess the <code class="LITERAL">CSV</code> file to remove the trailing white space, before importing the data into <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span>.</p> </blockquote>   <blockquote class="NOTE"> <p><b>Note:</b> CSV format will both recognize and produce CSV files with quoted values containing embedded carriage returns and line feeds. Thus the files are not strictly one line per table row like text-format files.</p> </blockquote>   <blockquote class="NOTE"> <p><b>Note:</b> Many programs produce strange and occasionally perverse CSV files, so the file format is more a convention than a standard. Thus you might encounter some files that cannot be imported using this mechanism, and <code class="COMMAND">COPY</code> might produce files that other programs cannot process.</p> </blockquote>  </div> <div class="REFSECT2" id="AEN72424">  <h3>Binary Format</h3> <p>The <code class="LITERAL">binary</code> format option causes all data to be stored/read as binary format rather than as text. It is somewhat faster than the text and <code class="LITERAL">CSV</code> formats, but a binary-format file is less portable across machine architectures and <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> versions. Also, the binary format is very data type specific; for example it will not work to output binary data from a <code class="TYPE">smallint</code> column and read it into an <code class="TYPE">integer</code> column, even though that would work fine in text format.</p> <p>The <code class="LITERAL">binary</code> file format consists of a file header, zero or more tuples containing the row data, and a file trailer. Headers and data are in network byte order.</p>  <blockquote class="NOTE"> <p><b>Note:</b> <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> releases before 7.4 used a different binary file format.</p> </blockquote>  <div class="REFSECT3" id="AEN72437">  <h4>File Header</h4> <p>The file header consists of 15 bytes of fixed fields, followed by a variable-length header extension area. The fixed fields are:</p> <div class="VARIABLELIST"> <dl> <dt>Signature</dt> <dd> <p>11-byte sequence <code class="LITERAL">PGCOPY\n\377\r\n\0</code> — note that the zero byte is a required part of the signature. (The signature is designed to allow easy identification of files that have been munged by a non-8-bit-clean transfer. This signature will be changed by end-of-line-translation filters, dropped zero bytes, dropped high bits, or parity changes.)</p> </dd> <dt>Flags field</dt> <dd> <p>32-bit integer bit mask to denote important aspects of the file format. Bits are numbered from 0 (<acronym class="ACRONYM">LSB</acronym>) to 31 (<acronym class="ACRONYM">MSB</acronym>). Note that this field is stored in network byte order (most significant byte first), as are all the integer fields used in the file format. Bits 16-31 are reserved to denote critical file format issues; a reader should abort if it finds an unexpected bit set in this range. Bits 0-15 are reserved to signal backwards-compatible format issues; a reader should simply ignore any unexpected bits set in this range. Currently only one flag bit is defined, and the rest must be zero:</p> <div class="VARIABLELIST"> <dl> <dt>Bit 16</dt> <dd> <p>if 1, OIDs are included in the data; if 0, not</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </dd> <dt>Header extension area length</dt> <dd> <p>32-bit integer, length in bytes of remainder of header, not including self. Currently, this is zero, and the first tuple follows immediately. Future changes to the format might allow additional data to be present in the header. A reader should silently skip over any header extension data it does not know what to do with.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>The header extension area is envisioned to contain a sequence of self-identifying chunks. The flags field is not intended to tell readers what is in the extension area. Specific design of header extension contents is left for a later release.</p> <p>This design allows for both backwards-compatible header additions (add header extension chunks, or set low-order flag bits) and non-backwards-compatible changes (set high-order flag bits to signal such changes, and add supporting data to the extension area if needed).</p> </div> <div class="REFSECT3" id="AEN72463">  <h4>Tuples</h4> <p>Each tuple begins with a 16-bit integer count of the number of fields in the tuple. (Presently, all tuples in a table will have the same count, but that might not always be true.) Then, repeated for each field in the tuple, there is a 32-bit length word followed by that many bytes of field data. (The length word does not include itself, and can be zero.) As a special case, -1 indicates a NULL field value. No value bytes follow in the NULL case.</p> <p>There is no alignment padding or any other extra data between fields.</p> <p>Presently, all data values in a binary-format file are assumed to be in binary format (format code one). It is anticipated that a future extension might add a header field that allows per-column format codes to be specified.</p> <p>To determine the appropriate binary format for the actual tuple data you should consult the <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> source, in particular the <code class="FUNCTION">*send</code> and <code class="FUNCTION">*recv</code> functions for each column's data type (typically these functions are found in the <code class="FILENAME">src/backend/utils/adt/</code> directory of the source distribution).</p> <p>If OIDs are included in the file, the OID field immediately follows the field-count word. It is a normal field except that it's not included in the field-count. In particular it has a length word — this will allow handling of 4-byte vs. 8-byte OIDs without too much pain, and will allow OIDs to be shown as null if that ever proves desirable.</p> </div> <div class="REFSECT3" id="AEN72474">  <h4>File Trailer</h4> <p>The file trailer consists of a 16-bit integer word containing -1. This is easily distinguished from a tuple's field-count word.</p> <p>A reader should report an error if a field-count word is neither -1 nor the expected number of columns. This provides an extra check against somehow getting out of sync with the data.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="REFSECT1" id="AEN72478">  <h2>Examples</h2> <p>The following example copies a table to the client using the vertical bar (<code class="LITERAL">|</code>) as the field delimiter:</p> <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING" data-language="sql">
