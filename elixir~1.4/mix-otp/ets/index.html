<h1 id="ets">ETS</h1>  <p>This chapter is part of the <i>Mix and OTP guide</i> and it depends on previous chapters in this guide. For more information, <a href="../introduction-to-mix/">read the introduction guide</a> or check out the chapter index in the sidebar.</p> <p>Every time we need to look up a bucket, we need to send a message to the registry. In case our registry is being accessed concurrently by multiple processes, the registry may become a bottleneck!</p> <p>In this chapter we will learn about ETS (Erlang Term Storage) and how to use it as a cache mechanism.</p> <blockquote> <p>Warning! Don’t use ETS as a cache prematurely! Log and analyze your application performance and identify which parts are bottlenecks, so you know <em>whether</em> you should cache, and <em>what</em> you should cache. This chapter is merely an example of how ETS can be used, once you’ve determined the need.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="ets-as-a-cache">ETS as a cache</h2> <p>ETS allows us to store any Elixir term in an in-memory table. Working with ETS tables is done via <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html" target="_blank">Erlang’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">:ets</code> module</a>:</p> <pre>iex&gt; table = :ets.new(:buckets_registry, [:set, :protected])
8207
iex&gt; :ets.insert(table, {"foo", self()})
true
iex&gt; :ets.lookup(table, "foo")
[{"foo", #PID&lt;0.41.0&gt;}]
</pre> <p>When creating an ETS table, two arguments are required: the table name and a set of options. From the available options, we passed the table type and its access rules. We have chosen the <code class="highlighter-rouge">:set</code> type, which means that keys cannot be duplicated. We’ve also set the table’s access to <code class="highlighter-rouge">:protected</code>, meaning only the process that created the table can write to it, but all processes can read from it. Those are actually the default values, so we will skip them from now on.</p> <p>ETS tables can also be named, allowing us to access them by a given name:</p> <pre>iex&gt; :ets.new(:buckets_registry, [:named_table])
:buckets_registry
iex&gt; :ets.insert(:buckets_registry, {"foo", self()})
true
iex&gt; :ets.lookup(:buckets_registry, "foo")
[{"foo", #PID&lt;0.41.0&gt;}]
</pre> <p>Let’s change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry</code> to use ETS tables. Since our registry requires a name as argument, we are going to name the ETS table with the same name as the registry. ETS names and process names are stored in different locations, so there is no chance of conflicts.</p> <p>Open up <code class="highlighter-rouge">lib/kv/registry.ex</code>, and let’s change its implementation. We’ve added comments to the source code to highlight the changes we’ve made:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">defmodule KV.Registry do
  use GenServer

  ## Client API

  @doc """
  Starts the registry with the given `name`.
  """
  def start_link(name) do
    # 1. Pass the name to GenServer's init
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, name, name: name)
  end

  @doc """
  Looks up the bucket pid for `name` stored in `server`.

  Returns `{:ok, pid}` if the bucket exists, `:error` otherwise.
  """
  def lookup(server, name) when is_atom(server) do
    # 2. Lookup is now done directly in ETS, without accessing the server
    case :ets.lookup(server, name) do
      [{^name, pid}] -&gt; {:ok, pid}
      [] -&gt; :error
    end
  end

  @doc """
  Ensures there is a bucket associated to the given `name` in `server`.
  """
  def create(server, name) do
    GenServer.cast(server, {:create, name})
  end

  @doc """
  Stops the registry.
  """
  def stop(server) do
    GenServer.stop(server)
  end

  ## Server callbacks

  def init(table) do
    # 3. We have replaced the names map by the ETS table
    names = :ets.new(table, [:named_table, read_concurrency: true])
    refs  = %{}
    {:ok, {names, refs}}
  end

  # 4. The previous handle_call callback for lookup was removed

  def handle_cast({:create, name}, {names, refs}) do
    # 5. Read and write to the ETS table instead of the map
    case lookup(names, name) do
      {:ok, _pid} -&gt;
        {:noreply, {names, refs}}
      :error -&gt;
        {:ok, pid} = KV.Bucket.Supervisor.start_bucket
        ref = Process.monitor(pid)
        refs = Map.put(refs, ref, name)
        :ets.insert(names, {name, pid})
        {:noreply, {names, refs}}
    end
  end

  def handle_info({:DOWN, ref, :process, _pid, _reason}, {names, refs}) do
    # 6. Delete from the ETS table instead of the map
    {name, refs} = Map.pop(refs, ref)
    :ets.delete(names, name)
    {:noreply, {names, refs}}
  end

  def handle_info(_msg, state) do
    {:noreply, state}
  end
end
</pre> <p>Notice that before our changes <code class="highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry.lookup/2</code> sent requests to the server, but now it reads directly from the ETS table, which is shared across all processes. That’s the main idea behind the cache mechanism we are implementing.</p> <p>In order for the cache mechanism to work, the created ETS table needs to have access <code class="highlighter-rouge">:protected</code> (the default), so all clients can read from it, while only the <code class="highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry</code> process writes to it. We have also set <code class="highlighter-rouge">read_concurrency: true</code> when starting the table, optimizing the table for the common scenario of concurrent read operations.</p> <p>The changes we have performed above have broken our tests because they were using the pid of the registry process for all operations and now the registry lookup requires the ETS table name. However, since the ETS table has the same name as the registry process, it is an easy fix. Change the setup function in <code class="highlighter-rouge">test/kv/registry_test.exs</code> to the following:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">setup context do
  {:ok, _} = KV.Registry.start_link(context.test)
  {:ok, registry: context.test}
end
</pre> <p>Once we change <code class="highlighter-rouge">setup</code>, some tests will continue to fail. You may even notice tests pass and fail inconsistently between runs. For example, the “spawns buckets” test:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">test "spawns buckets", %{registry: registry} do
  assert KV.Registry.lookup(registry, "shopping") == :error

  KV.Registry.create(registry, "shopping")
  assert {:ok, bucket} = KV.Registry.lookup(registry, "shopping")

  KV.Bucket.put(bucket, "milk", 1)
  assert KV.Bucket.get(bucket, "milk") == 1
end
</pre> <p>may be failing on this line:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">{:ok, bucket} = KV.Registry.lookup(registry, "shopping")
</pre> <p>How can this line fail if we just created the bucket in the previous line?</p> <p>The reason those failures are happening is because, for didactic purposes, we have made two mistakes:</p> <ol> <li>We are prematurely optimizing (by adding this cache layer)</li> <li>We are using <code class="highlighter-rouge">cast/2</code> (while we should be using <code class="highlighter-rouge">call/2</code>)</li> </ol> <h2 id="race-conditions">Race conditions?</h2> <p>Developing in Elixir does not make your code free of race conditions. However, Elixir’s simple abstractions where nothing is shared by default make it easier to spot a race condition’s root cause.</p> <p>What is happening in our tests is that there is a delay in between an operation and the time we can observe this change in the ETS table. Here is what we were expecting to happen:</p> <ol> <li>We invoke <code class="highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry.create(registry, "shopping")</code>
</li> <li>The registry creates the bucket and updates the cache table</li> <li>We access the information from the table with <code class="highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry.lookup(registry, "shopping")</code>
</li> <li>The command above returns <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">:ok,</span><span class="err">bucket</span><span class="p">}</span></code>
</li> </ol> <p>However, since <code class="highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry.create/2</code> is a cast operation, the command will return before we actually write to the table! In other words, this is happening:</p> <ol> <li>We invoke <code class="highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry.create(registry, "shopping")</code>
</li> <li>We access the information from the table with <code class="highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry.lookup(registry, "shopping")</code>
</li> <li>The command above returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">:error</code>
</li> <li>The registry creates the bucket and updates the cache table</li> </ol> <p>To fix the failure we need to make <code class="highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry.create/2</code> synchronous by using <code class="highlighter-rouge">call/2</code> rather than <code class="highlighter-rouge">cast/2</code>. This will guarantee that the client will only continue after changes have been made to the table. Let’s change the function and its callback as follows:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">def create(server, name) do
  GenServer.call(server, {:create, name})
end

def handle_call({:create, name}, _from, {names, refs}) do
  case lookup(names, name) do
    {:ok, pid} -&gt;
      {:reply, pid, {names, refs}}
    :error -&gt;
      {:ok, pid} = KV.Bucket.Supervisor.start_bucket
      ref = Process.monitor(pid)
      refs = Map.put(refs, ref, name)
      :ets.insert(names, {name, pid})
      {:reply, pid, {names, refs}}
  end
end
</pre> <p>We changed the callback from <code class="highlighter-rouge">handle_cast/2</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">handle_call/3</code> and changed it to reply with the pid of the created bucket. Generally speaking, Elixir developers prefer to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">call/2</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">cast/2</code> as it also provides back-pressure (you block until you get a reply). Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">cast/2</code> when not necessary can also be considered a premature optimization.</p> <p>Let’s run the tests once again. This time though, we will pass the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--trace</code> option:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="bash">$ mix test --trace
</pre> <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">--trace</code> option is useful when your tests are deadlocking or there are race conditions, as it runs all tests synchronously (<code class="highlighter-rouge">async: true</code> has no effect) and shows detailed information about each test. This time we should be down to one or two intermittent failures:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="">  1) test removes buckets on exit (KV.RegistryTest)
     test/kv/registry_test.exs:19
     Assertion with == failed
     code: KV.Registry.lookup(registry, "shopping") == :error
     lhs:  {:ok, #PID&lt;0.109.0&gt;}
     rhs:  :error
     stacktrace:
       test/kv/registry_test.exs:23
</pre> <p>According to the failure message, we are expecting that the bucket no longer exists on the table, but it still does! This problem is the opposite of the one we have just solved: while previously there was a delay between the command to create a bucket and updating the table, now there is a delay between the bucket process dying and its entry being removed from the table.</p> <p>Unfortunately this time we cannot simply change <code class="highlighter-rouge">handle_info/2</code>, the operation responsible for cleaning the ETS table, to a synchronous operation. Instead we need to find a way to guarantee the registry has processed the <code class="highlighter-rouge">:DOWN</code> notification sent when the bucket crashed.</p> <p>An easy way to do so is by sending a synchronous request to the registry: because messages are processed in order, if the registry replies to a request sent after the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Agent.stop</code> call, it means that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">:DOWN</code> message has been processed. Let’s do so by creating a “bogus” bucket, which is a synchronous request, after <code class="highlighter-rouge">Agent.stop</code> in both tests:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">test "removes buckets on exit", %{registry: registry} do
  KV.Registry.create(registry, "shopping")
  {:ok, bucket} = KV.Registry.lookup(registry, "shopping")
  Agent.stop(bucket)

  # Do a call to ensure the registry processed the DOWN message
  _ = KV.Registry.create(registry, "bogus")
  assert KV.Registry.lookup(registry, "shopping") == :error
end

test "removes bucket on crash", %{registry: registry} do
  KV.Registry.create(registry, "shopping")
  {:ok, bucket} = KV.Registry.lookup(registry, "shopping")

  # Kill the bucket and wait for the notification
  Process.exit(bucket, :shutdown)

  # Wait until the bucket is dead
  ref = Process.monitor(bucket)
  assert_receive {:DOWN, ^ref, _, _, _}

  # Do a call to ensure the registry processed the DOWN message
  _ = KV.Registry.create(registry, "bogus")
  assert KV.Registry.lookup(registry, "shopping") == :error
end
</pre> <p>Our tests should now (always) pass!</p> <p>This concludes our optimization chapter. We have used ETS as a cache mechanism where reads can happen from any processes but writes are still serialized through a single process. More importantly, we have also learned that once data can be read asynchronously, we need to be aware of the race conditions it might introduce.</p> <p>Next let’s discuss external and internal dependencies and how Mix helps us manage large codebases.</p>
