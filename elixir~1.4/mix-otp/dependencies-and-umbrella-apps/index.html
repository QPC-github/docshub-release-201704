<h1 id="dependencies-and-umbrella-projects">Dependencies and umbrella projects</h1>  <p>This chapter is part of the <i>Mix and OTP guide</i> and it depends on previous chapters in this guide. For more information, <a href="../introduction-to-mix/">read the introduction guide</a> or check out the chapter index in the sidebar.</p> <p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to manage dependencies in Mix.</p> <p>Our <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv</code> application is complete, so it’s time to implement the server that will handle the requests we defined in the first chapter:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="">CREATE shopping
OK

PUT shopping milk 1
OK

PUT shopping eggs 3
OK

GET shopping milk
1
OK

DELETE shopping eggs
OK
</pre> <p>However, instead of adding more code to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv</code> application, we are going to build the TCP server as another application that is a client of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv</code> application. Since the whole runtime and Elixir ecosystem are geared towards applications, it makes sense to break our projects into smaller applications that work together rather than building a big, monolithic app.</p> <p>Before creating our new application, we must discuss how Mix handles dependencies. In practice, there are two kinds of dependencies we usually work with: internal and external dependencies. Mix supports mechanisms to work with both of them.</p> <h2 id="external-dependencies">External dependencies</h2> <p>External dependencies are the ones not tied to your business domain. For example, if you need a HTTP API for your distributed KV application, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug" target="_blank">Plug</a> project as an external dependency.</p> <p>Installing external dependencies is simple. Most commonly, we use the <a href="https://hex.pm" target="_blank">Hex Package Manager</a>, by listing the dependency inside the deps function in our <code class="highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code> file:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">def deps do
  [{:plug, "~&gt; 1.0"}]
end
</pre> <p>This dependency refers to the latest version of Plug in the 1.x.x version series that has been pushed to Hex. This is indicated by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">~&gt;</code> preceding the version number. For more information on specifying version requirements, see the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Version.html" target="_blank">documentation for the Version module</a>.</p> <p>Typically, stable releases are pushed to Hex. If you want to depend on an external dependency still in development, Mix is able to manage git dependencies too:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">def deps do
  [{:plug, git: "git://github.com/elixir-lang/plug.git"}]
end
</pre> <p>You will notice that when you add a dependency to your project, Mix generates a <code class="highlighter-rouge">mix.lock</code> file that guarantees <em>repeatable builds</em>. The lock file must be checked in to your version control system, to guarantee that everyone who uses the project will use the same dependency versions as you.</p> <p>Mix provides many tasks for working with dependencies, which can be seen in <code class="highlighter-rouge">mix help</code>:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="bash">$ mix help
mix deps              # Lists dependencies and their status
mix deps.clean        # Deletes the given dependencies' files
mix deps.compile      # Compiles dependencies
mix deps.get          # Gets all out of date dependencies
mix deps.tree         # Prints the dependency tree
mix deps.unlock       # Unlocks the given dependencies
mix deps.update       # Updates the given dependencies
</pre> <p>The most common tasks are <code class="highlighter-rouge">mix deps.get</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mix deps.update</code>. Once fetched, dependencies are automatically compiled for you. You can read more about deps by typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">mix help deps</code>, and in the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Deps.html" target="_blank">documentation for the Mix.Tasks.Deps module</a>.</p> <h2 id="internal-dependencies">Internal dependencies</h2> <p>Internal dependencies are the ones that are specific to your project. They usually don’t make sense outside the scope of your project/company/organization. Most of the time, you want to keep them private, whether due to technical, economic or business reasons.</p> <p>If you have an internal dependency, Mix supports two methods to work with them: git repositories or umbrella projects.</p> <p>For example, if you push the <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv</code> project to a git repository, you’ll need to list it in your deps code in order to use it:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">def deps do
  [{:kv, git: "https://github.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT/kv.git"}]
end
</pre> <p>If the repository is private though, you may need to specify the private URL <code class="highlighter-rouge">git@github.com:YOUR_ACCOUNT/kv.git</code>. In any case, Mix will be able to fetch it for you as long as you have the proper credentials.</p> <p>Using git dependencies for internal dependencies is somewhat discouraged in Elixir. Remember that the runtime and the Elixir ecosystem already provide the concept of applications. As such, we expect you to frequently break your code into applications that can be organized logically, even within a single project.</p> <p>However, if you push every application as a separate project to a git repository, your projects may become very hard to maintain as you will spend a lot of time managing those git repositories rather than writing your code.</p> <p>For this reason, Mix supports “umbrella projects.” Umbrella projects allow you to create one project that hosts many applications while keeping all of them in a single source code repository. That is exactly the style we are going to explore in the next sections.</p> <p>Let’s create a new Mix project. We are going to creatively name it <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv_umbrella</code>, and this new project will have both the existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv</code> application and the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv_server</code> application inside. The directory structure will look like this:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="">+ kv_umbrella
  + apps
    + kv
    + kv_server
</pre> <p>The interesting thing about this approach is that Mix has many conveniences for working with such projects, such as the ability to compile and test all applications inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">apps</code> with a single command. However, even though they are all listed together inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">apps</code>, they are still decoupled from each other, so you can build, test and deploy each application in isolation if you want to.</p> <p>So let’s get started!</p> <h2 id="umbrella-projects">Umbrella projects</h2> <p>Let’s start a new project using <code class="highlighter-rouge">mix new</code>. This new project will be named <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv_umbrella</code> and we need to pass the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--umbrella</code> option when creating it. Do not create this new project inside the existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv</code> project!</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="bash">$ mix new kv_umbrella --umbrella
* creating .gitignore
* creating README.md
* creating mix.exs
* creating apps
* creating config
* creating config/config.exs
</pre> <p>From the printed information, we can see far fewer files are generated. The generated <code class="highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code> file is different too. Let’s take a look (comments have been removed):</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">defmodule KvUmbrella.Mixfile do
  use Mix.Project

  def project do
    [apps_path: "apps",
     build_embedded: Mix.env == :prod,
     start_permanent: Mix.env == :prod,
     deps: deps]
  end

  defp deps do
    []
  end
end
</pre> <p>What makes this project different from the previous one is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">apps_path: "apps"</code> entry in the project definition. This means this project will act as an umbrella. Such projects do not have source files nor tests, although they can have their own dependencies. Each child application must be defined inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">apps</code> directory.</p> <p>Let’s move inside the apps directory and start building <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv_server</code>. This time, we are going to pass the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--sup</code> flag, which will tell Mix to generate a supervision tree automatically for us, instead of building one manually as we did in previous chapters:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="bash">$ cd kv_umbrella/apps
$ mix new kv_server --module KVServer --sup
</pre> <p>The generated files are similar to the ones we first generated for <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv</code>, with a few differences. Let’s open up <code class="highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code>:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">defmodule KVServer.Mixfile do
  use Mix.Project

  def project do
    [app: :kv_server,
     version: "0.1.0",
     build_path: "../../_build",
     config_path: "../../config/config.exs",
     deps_path: "../../deps",
     lockfile: "../../mix.lock",
     elixir: "~&gt; 1.3",
     build_embedded: Mix.env == :prod,
     start_permanent: Mix.env == :prod,
     deps: deps]
  end

  def application do
    [extra_applications: [:logger],
     mod: {KVServer.Application, []}]
  end

  defp deps do
    []
  end
end

</pre> <p>First of all, since we generated this project inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv_umbrella/apps</code>, Mix automatically detected the umbrella structure and added four lines to the project definition:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">build_path: "../../_build",
config_path: "../../config/config.exs",
deps_path: "../../deps",
lockfile: "../../mix.lock",
</pre> <p>Those options mean all dependencies will be checked out to <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv_umbrella/deps</code>, and they will share the same build, config and lock files. This ensures dependencies will be fetched and compiled once for the whole umbrella structure, instead of once per umbrella application.</p> <p>The second change is in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">application</code> function inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code>:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">def application do
  [extra_applications: [:logger],
   mod: {KVServer.Application, []}]
end
</pre> <p>Because we passed the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--sup</code> flag, Mix automatically added <code class="highlighter-rouge">mod: {KVServer.Application, []}</code>, specifying that <code class="highlighter-rouge">KVServer.Application</code> is our application callback module. <code class="highlighter-rouge">KVServer.Application</code> will start our application supervision tree.</p> <p>In fact, let’s open up <code class="highlighter-rouge">lib/kv_server/application.ex</code>:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">defmodule KVServer.Application do
  # See http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Application.html
  # for more information on OTP Applications
  @moduledoc false

  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    import Supervisor.Spec, warn: false

    # Define workers and child supervisors to be supervised
    children = [
      # Starts a worker by calling: KVServer.Worker.start_link(arg1, arg2, arg3)
      # worker(KVServer.Worker, [arg1, arg2, arg3]),
    ]

    # See http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Supervisor.html
    # for other strategies and supported options
    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: KVServer.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
</pre> <p>Notice that it defines the application callback function, <code class="highlighter-rouge">start/2</code>, and instead of defining a supervisor named <code class="highlighter-rouge">KVServer.Supervisor</code> that uses the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Supervisor</code> module, it conveniently defined the supervisor inline! You can read more about such supervisors by reading <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html" target="_blank">the Supervisor module documentation</a>.</p> <p>We can already try out our first umbrella child. We could run tests inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">apps/kv_server</code> directory, but that wouldn’t be much fun. Instead, go to the root of the umbrella project and run <code class="highlighter-rouge">mix test</code>:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="bash">$ mix test
</pre> <p>And it works!</p> <p>Since we want <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv_server</code> to eventually use the functionality we defined in <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv</code>, we need to add <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv</code> as a dependency to our application.</p> <h2 id="in-umbrella-dependencies">In umbrella dependencies</h2> <p>Mix supports an easy mechanism to make one umbrella child depend on another. Open up <code class="highlighter-rouge">apps/kv_server/mix.exs</code> and change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">deps/0</code> function to the following:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">defp deps do
  [{:kv, in_umbrella: true}]
end
</pre> <p>The line above makes <code class="highlighter-rouge">:kv</code> available as a dependency inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">:kv_server</code> and automatically starts the <code class="highlighter-rouge">:kv</code> application before the server starts.</p> <p>Finally, copy the <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv</code> application we have built so far to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">apps</code> directory in our new umbrella project. The final directory structure should match the structure we mentioned earlier:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="">+ kv_umbrella
  + apps
    + kv
    + kv_server
</pre> <p>We now need to modify <code class="highlighter-rouge">apps/kv/mix.exs</code> to contain the umbrella entries we have seen in <code class="highlighter-rouge">apps/kv_server/mix.exs</code>. Open up <code class="highlighter-rouge">apps/kv/mix.exs</code> and add to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">project</code> function:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="elixir">build_path: "../../_build",
config_path: "../../config/config.exs",
deps_path: "../../deps",
lockfile: "../../mix.lock",
</pre> <p>Now you can run tests for both projects from the umbrella root with <code class="highlighter-rouge">mix test</code>. Sweet!</p> <p>Remember that umbrella projects are a convenience to help you organize and manage your applications. Applications inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">apps</code> directory are still decoupled from each other. Dependencies between them must be explicitly listed. This allows them to be developed together, but compiled, tested and deployed independently if desired.</p> <h2 id="summing-up">Summing up</h2> <p>In this chapter we have learned more about Mix dependencies and umbrella projects. We have decided to build an umbrella project because we consider <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">kv_server</code> to be internal dependencies that matter only in the context of this project.</p> <p>In the future, you are going to write applications and you will notice they can be extracted into a concise unit that can be used by different projects. In such cases, using Git or Hex dependencies is the way to go.</p> <p>Here are a couple questions you can ask yourself when working with dependencies. Start with: does this application make sense outside this project?</p> <ul> <li>If no, use an umbrella project with umbrella children.</li> <li>If yes, can this project be shared outside your company / organization? <ul> <li>If no, use a private git repository.</li> <li>If yes, push your code to a git repository and do frequent releases using <a href="https://hex.pm" target="_blank">Hex</a>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>With our umbrella project up and running, it is time to start writing our server.</p>
